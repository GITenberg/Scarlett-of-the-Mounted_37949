<h2>SCARLETT <i>of the</i> MOUNTED</h2>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2><a id="I"></a>I</h2>

<p class="h3">LOST SHOE CREEK</p>

<p>Parson MacLane came running
along the rough trail, his dogs,
Telegraph and Wrangel, named
after former mission charges, following.
As he paused at the crest of a hill to take
breath and wipe the grime from his face he
smiled, for over the thicket of scrub willow
that lay between him and Lost Shoe Creek
rose the voices of the "boys" he had traveled
far to reach. Then he sighed, because
the jest and song, as he heard them, were
ribald; the laughter thick with drink.
Finally, reflecting that in no human heart
had he ever found evil so strong but that
the good was stronger, he smiled again, and
stooping to pluck from a low-growing bush
the deep crimson wild rose of the north, he
set this in his buttonhole, and squaring his
shoulders for a fresh bout with his old adversary
of horns and cloven hoof, trotted
cheerily down the steep incline.</p>

<p>With an expiring wheeze the concertina<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
dropped from the singer's hand. One of the
group playing Black Jack, looked up. "Go
on, Bill! Thar's other verses&mdash;an' each
more decorative than the last!"</p>

<p>Lighting a pipe, Bill shook his head.
"Grand opera sore throat! Left my music
at home&mdash;and home," he added, under his
ragged mustache, "is so cursed far away!"</p>

<p>Mops' remonstrance was cut short by a
disparaging comment on his methods of
card-playing from a raw-boned Scotchman
who had lost an inconsiderable amount.
"You accuse me o' cheatin'?"</p>

<p>"Aweel!" Sandy scratched his head.
"While it's na' to say cheating it's na' to
say fair playing neither!"</p>

<p>"You liar!" kicking over the barrel that
served for a table, with a volley of oaths
Mops sprang at him, and a free fight would
have ensued but for the intervention of the
more cautious, who, pointing to a squalid
bundle from which lusty snores were issuing,
reminded the belligerents that if Bully
Nick were roused from his innocent slumbers
some indiscriminate gun-play might be
looked for, transmuting every mother's son
into cold meat. This argument prevailed;
peace was restored and celebrated in the
dire wassail of the district, served in the
open by Ikey, bartender of the dilapidated<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
refreshment-tent nearby, and by general
consent charged to the protesting but helpless
Sandy.</p>

<p>It was at this auspicious moment that, followed
by his dogs, rose in buttonhole, and
with smiling countenance, Parson Maclane
made his entrance into the camp on Lost
Shoe Creek.</p>

<p>Hailing the newcomer as dude and tenderfoot,
with winks and nudges among
themselves the men prepared to "have fun"
with him. Raising their glasses in derisive
welcome, "Hello, stranger!" they chorused.
"'Drink your health!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, friends, but I fear you are not
drinking your own!"</p>

<p>"By gum," cried Mops, delightedly, "if he
ain't a blamed teetotaller!"</p>

<p>"The Laird kens we hae need o' sic," hiccoughed
Sandy. "Hoots, but we're a sinfu'
crew! Ikey, lad, mair whuskey!"</p>

<p>While glasses were being refilled, this
time at Mops' expense, Maclane went toward
the tent, over whose entrance hung
the sign KLONDIKE DELMONICO'S.
GUMBOOT ANNIE. Addressing the plump
female in jersey and culottes, who lolled
beneath, picking her teeth skilfully: "Good
day, madam," he began, baring his head. "I
should like to speak with the proprietor."<span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>Gumboot Annie took time to spit before
replying, "I am the lady."</p>

<p>"I want to hold a prayer-meeting. Will
you lend me your tent?"</p>

<p>"Lend! Me lend anything! Now wouldn't
that pa'alyze yer!" she demanded of the
listening prospectors. "I ain't up here fer
me health," she then explained to Maclane,
"but I'll sell or rent anything in sight.
Twenty dollars is the price for a Gospel
show!"</p>

<p>"Agreed!"</p>

<p>"Thar's a bar in thar, y'know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the bar's no hindrance!" The minister
already was unstrapping his pack of
hymnals. "But I warn you I shall preach
against the evils of drink."</p>

<p>"That's all right. The boys ull be jest as
thirsty! Say, fer five dollars you kin convert
Ikey. He's useter it. He gives his experiences
real cute. Water is two bits a
bucket, but fer a baptism attraction I'll
throw it in!"</p>

<p>Refusing with a gesture, the minister
seized the dinner-bell from its nail and rang
it vigorously. "Prayer-meeting and service
of song. All are cordially welcome!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be slick ter dump him in the
creek," suggested one.</p>

<p>"No, no! Lay low till Bully Nick wakes<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
up! Nick ull fix him," said Mops, to which
the rest agreed, "Betcherlife!"</p>

<p>"Come, boys," urged Maclane, "who'll
lead the way?"</p>

<p>After a chilly silence, "Don't all speak at
once," jeered Mops. "Don't crowd the
mourners," echoed Bill.</p>

<p>"You have mothers, sweethearts, wives,
who never cease to pray for you. Won't
you spare a few minutes from Black Jack to
put up a prayer for them?"</p>

<p>A pause followed, during which Bill
swallowed a lump in his throat and tried
not to think of the mother in Montreal,
whose last letter he had been carrying about
for eleven months, unanswered. Mops sent
Ikey for more drinks.</p>

<p>"'Twull be a saving i' the lang run!"
Foreseeing that he might again be called
upon to pay, Sandy stumbled toward the
tent, falling over rows of jocosely outstretched
feet. "I misdoot my gait is na
sae steady as it micht be! A touch o'
scurvy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all liable to trip!" Maclane
helped him up. "Who'll be next?"</p>

<p>"Count me in, Dominie!" An elderly man,
gaunt and ill-clad, gold-pan under his arm,
climbed the banks of the creek and entered
the tent.<span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>"Old Lucky's down on his luck, but he
gen'lly knows whar the gold is!" A boyish-looking
prospector, who had been wanting
an excuse, joined him.</p>

<p>Several followed the example, till at last
only Nick and his bodyguard remained outside.
When a rousing chorus of "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," pealed forth from the
tent, Mops chuckled joyously. "Look out
fer fireworks! Nick's waking!"</p>

<p>After preliminary grunts and stretchings
the Bully sat up in his ugliest mood. "Wot
th' hell&mdash;&mdash; Is this Jedgment Day?"</p>

<p>"Naw! Only some blasted holy windmill
come for to save our souls," Bill informed
him.</p>

<p>"The cursed stiff!" Nick sprang toward
the tent. "I'll teach him ter meddle with
my anatomy!" He cocked his pistol. "One,
two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bully Nick! He never misses the bull's-eye!"
shouted his delighted followers.</p>

<p>At this juncture a fresh-skinned young
giant in blouse and overalls, who had been
chopping kindlings by Gumboot Annie's
woodpile, dropped his hatchet and strolled
up with a casual air wholly at variance with
the keen, hawk-like glance of his gray-blue
eyes. As Nick told off the last minutes of
Parson Maclane's earthly span, the newcomer<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
pinioned him in a grasp of iron from
behind. "Not this time, Bully Nick!"</p>

<p>"Eh? Who the mischief are ye to stop
me?" is the polite, free rendering of Nick's
impolite free speech. "I don't think I hev
the pleasure of your acquaintance, my lad!"</p>

<p>"I've been wanting for some time to make
yours!" The young man seemed quite unconcerned
that the toughest gang in the
district had forcibly detached him from
their chief and were holding him prisoner.</p>

<p>"It's just a looney Irishman that's been
hanging 'round all day! Ain't worth a bullet,
Nick!" At heart, Bill disliked human
targets for sport.</p>

<p>"Powerful strong! His muscles ud be
wuth more ter ye than his darned hide,
Nick," supplemented Mops, who, while without
prejudices as to bloodshed, sometimes
was called on to exert himself unduly.</p>

<p>"I'll assay him," decreed the Bully. "Fust
he shall drink my health! Mops, you hold
the booze ter the stiff's mouth! Bill, you
got a ticker; you keep time. Now, sonny, I
give yer jest two minutes fer mamma's little
baby boy ter say his prayers in, or ter git
good an' drunk, like me. See?"</p>

<p>The young man yawned, with a bored expression.
"Excuse my not putting my hand
before my mouth, gentlemen!"<span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>"One minute gone, pard!" admonished
Bill.</p>

<p>"Phew!" The prisoner spat out the liquid
Mops forced between his lips. "That filthy
stuff! I only drink the best! Besides, 'tis
smuggled, and, living or dead, I should incur
a fine with contraband goods on, or in,
my person!"</p>

<p>"You all-fired nateral, do yer <i>want</i> ter be
a angel?" growled the Bully.</p>

<p>"Faith, I wasn't aspiring to such promotion,"
admitted the stranger. "But I'd look
prettier that way than making myself a
drunken beast like you, Nick!"</p>

<p>The insult had its effect; the Bully's pistol
hand quavered, and he was lost. "Say,
young feller, you got grit! You're game!
Boys, the Irishman goes, see!"</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't return the favor, Nick!
You go&mdash;but to gaol!" With an adroit
movement the young man had whisked out
a pair of handcuffs and was fitting them to
the astonished Bully's wrists. "Best take
it quietly, men. As they say in story-books,
reinforcements are at hand! And till they
come, get in there, all of you, and say your
own prayers!" He lifted the tent flap. "Fall
into line. Um, left. Left!&mdash;Left! March!"</p>

<p>"Who in blazes air ye?" gasped Nick, as
he obeyed.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>The answer came in awe-stricken tones
from Mops, who, beneath the stranger's
rough externals had suddenly suspected the
insignia of a dreaded authority. "The hell!
It's Scarlett of the Mounted!"</p>

<h2><a id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="h3">THE WOMENKIND OF LOST SHOE CREEK</p>

<p>Dandy Raish swaggered up to the
tent where he had an appointment
with old Blenksoe, relating to a
little matter of holding up the stage, but
finding services in progress, he scattered a
few flowers of profanity, and turned on his
heel.</p>

<p>Scarlett, pacing to and fro while awaiting
aid, caught sight of him. "Now, that's a
gentleman whose company I'd fancy most in
his absence, I'm thinking!" To escape the
other's observation while making his own,
he returned to his kindlings.</p>

<p>Developments came soon, first in the person
of a woman wrapped in a red cloak,
young and comely, but at the moment repulsive
from the effects of a debauch. Reeling
from the shelter of a ruined cabin,
"Gumboot Annie!" she cried, "Gumboot
Annie, for the love of heaven, trust me with
the price of a drink!"<span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>Finding the source of refreshments temporarily
inaccessible, she threw herself on
a bench, cursing religion, even as Raish had
done.</p>

<p>"Furs for sale; snow-shoes, moccasins,
furs, velly damn fine!" An Indian trader
coming by recognized the girl, and accosted
her. "Hello, Gelly! Shake!"</p>

<p>The girl complied good-naturedly. "Hello,
Chilkat Jo!"</p>

<p>"Gelly, I love you!" stated Jo, in unimpassioned
monotone. "Love you like hell-you-betyerlife!
Say, Gelly, you mally me?"</p>

<p>"Say, Jo, that's a proposal, even if you
ain't nothin' but a Siwash!"</p>

<p>"Me no Siwash!" Chilkat Jo drew himself
up. "Me chew, swear, gamble, dlink like
hell, plenty wives, all same as Clistian white
man!"</p>

<p>"My, but you do give us a character,"
laughed the girl, "and I guess we've earned
it all right, all right! But, no, Jo! I ain't
sunk so low I'd marry you without I cared
fer yer! Thar's only one man in the world
fer me!" With a sigh she looked over at
Dandy Raish, who, leaning against a Douglas
spruce, was dressing his waxed mustache
by the aid of a pocket looking-glass.</p>

<p>The Indian took his rejection with outward<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
stoicism. "That's all light. Some day
I kill him, cally you off, beat you, smash yer
face, make you goddam' bad husband, all
same as Clistian white man!" Then off he
stalked, crying: "Furs for sale. Moccasins.
Hair dye! Sacled images! Velly dam good
sacled images!"</p>

<p>Gelly rose and timidly approached the object
of her affections. "Raish! Dear Dandy,
won't you speak to me?"</p>

<p>"Gelly!" The man turned on her with an
oath. "Taggin' on as usual!"</p>

<p>"Raish, pop's turned me out, along of you,
and I don't know whar ter go!"</p>

<p>"Such as you needn't look far! There,
there, Gelly, don't get mad! I'm sorry for
you; indeed I am!"</p>

<p>"Then marry me!"</p>

<p>"Me marry you! With my social gifts!
Ha, ha! You're crazy! But I'll tell you
what I will do: I'll help you out of this
place; I'll get you a berth in a swell saloon
at Skagway, with a big rake-off on every
bottle that's uncorked and every bird that's
plucked through you!"</p>

<p>"And me tryin' to be decent! Curse it all,
I <i>will</i> be decent! You <i>shall</i> marry me!"</p>

<p>"I'll strangle you first!"</p>

<p>"Take your hands off that woman!"</p>

<p>Turning, Raish confronted a young giant,<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
and being a coward he obeyed. "I can't
spoil her!" he sneered.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" Scarlett asked of
Gelly.</p>

<p>"None of your business," she replied, with
feminine ingratitude.</p>

<p>"Is this your husband?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" At Raish's threatening gesture
she modified the assertion. "In a sort of
way!"</p>

<p>"The only sort of way he ever will be, you
bet your boots," Raish flung back as, hands
in pockets, he swaggered off.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" Scarlett asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"Gelly!"</p>

<p>"Your full name? Gelly what?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now you're gettin' too familiar!"
Sidling closer she remarked, approvingly:
"Say, you're an awful pretty boy!"</p>

<p>"Stand off!" As the girl shrank back,
cowering, he added more gently: "Go home
to your parents!"</p>

<p>"My home! My parents! Aw, that's a
good un! Ma sloped with a faro dealer from
'Frisco, and pop's turned me out!"</p>

<p>"Poor child! You must get away from
this district! I will send you down to a
mission, where good women will care for
you!"<span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>"A mission? No, sirree! Too slow fer
me!" Gelly moved away, humming a ditty
popular in low-class music-halls of the locality.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Scarlett sharply reprimanded.
"Sing if you will! Sing all you can! The
world has need of singing&mdash;but sing decent
songs!" As a stirring hymn, accompanied
by Bill's concertina, just then sounded from
the tent, he went on: "Go in and help them!
They need a woman's voice."</p>

<p>"What!" Gelly was genuinely astonished.
"Such as me&mdash;in church!"</p>

<p>"My poor girl, churches are for such as
you."</p>

<p>Gelly looked in, uncertainly, then hurriedly
drew back. "I can't, mister. Pop's
in thar&mdash;and pop has sworn ter kill me on
sight! Pop's the bully of the district," she
added, proudly.</p>

<p>"Hm!" Scarlett considered a moment,
then felt in his pocket. "Here's needle and
thread. Go mend your clothes!"</p>

<p>Gelly stared at him as she took the proffered
housewife. "Say, you're a real white
man. I never before&mdash;&mdash;" Breaking into
sudden sobbing, she went back to her cabin.</p>

<p>Sergeant Scarlett gave a comprehensive
glance at the scenery, nature's magnificent
setting for this squalid drama.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>"This district has the name of being the
hottest proposition this side of Hades," he
reflected. "It contains an unsurveyed number
of square miles and crooked inhabitants.
And it needs just three things to clean it
out. First, godliness, which only gets this
way for a flying visit once a year. Next&mdash;and
it's only modesty prevented my putting
it first&mdash;law, which is just myself; and last,
but foremost, women! And all the womenkind
we can muster are a travesty of the
name&mdash;sketches the Lord seems to have
blotted in the making and thrown away."
With tender impatience he touched a cluster
of wild roses with the toe of his military
boot. "Oh, why can't ye stop running to
flowers and blossom girls instead! Hello!
Is this an answer to prayer, or a deceiving
dream?" Sure enough, among the crimson
petals a girl's face laughed, sparkling back
at him. "By the St. Colmcille, a young
lady at me feet! Permit me to reverse the
positions, miss!" Picking up the miniature,
he scanned the features closely. "Young?
Yes, the right age, just; still in her teens,
but not too teeny! Pretty? Verdict unanimous,
without leaving the jury-box; guilty
of wholesale manslaughter wherever those
eyes set foot! Good? As good as virgin
gold! Perhaps a trifle too well pleased with<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
herself. Here, young lady, give an account
of yourself! What are you doing in my district?
Are you visiting father, brother,
sweetheart, or do you intend to stake a
claim on some poor wretch's unprospected
heart? Oh, here's a bit of writing on the
back. 'For dear daddy, from Evelyn,'
Evelyn. A pretty name. Sounds like Eve
with a little flounce on. Daddy. I'm glad
it's a mere father ye belong to. Now since
ye've dropped like manna from heaven to
the wilderness, will ye think it a liberty if
I&mdash;&mdash;" He approached the picture to his
lips, then put it resolutely aside. "No! I'm
not the coward to kiss a girl anyway but
to her face!" In his absorption he had
failed to observe a uniformed rider coming
at full gallop along the trail, and he had
barely time to conceal the miniature in his
breast as Barney, his assistant and devoted
personal follower, dismounted a few paces
from him.</p>

<p>Instead of greeting his chief with the
proper military salute, Barney pushed him
arrogantly aside.</p>

<p>"Out av the shadow av your supariors, ye
hulking son av a tiligraph pole!"</p>

<p>"Back into your own skin, you jackass,
you!" Scarlett returned the push with interest.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>Recognizing the other through his disguise,
"Bejabers," exclaimed Barney, "'tis
Himself!"</p>

<p>"You're late in coming up to time," remarked
Scarlett, absently, his thoughts still
on the portrait.</p>

<p>"Sure, sorr, an' 'twas the word from yourself
I've been delaying for! Ivery moment
av the last four-an'-twenty hours I've slept
at attintion with me boots on and nary a
wink on me! As me own flesh is livin' witness,
I've never moved me hindquarters
from the saddle!"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd learn to keep your headquarters
in the saddle," returned Scarlett.
"Didn't I instruct ye if ye hadn't heard
from me by the day appointed to start the
day before?"</p>

<p>Barney scratched a puzzled head. He
could interpret his own Irish bulls readily
enough, defending them, if needful, with his
fists to a jury of his peers, but those of his
chief often passed him. Tactfully, he
changed the conversation. "The mail arrived,
Sergeant, and was distributed impartially.
Only this remains unclaimed; a
registhry package, with duty to pay on it."</p>

<p>Sergeant Scarlett examined the address
on the parcel. "From E. Durant, New York
City, to Matthew Durant, owner of the<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
Rainbow Mine&mdash;&mdash; Where under the shining
heavens is the Rainbow Mine, Barney?" he
broke off to ask.</p>

<p>"In the clouds, for aught I know, sorr. I
searched the books, but in all the disthrict
there's not even a claim recorded by the
name, far less a mine."</p>

<p>"H'm! Well, the man, if not his mine, may
be sojourning in our bally. Step inside the
tent, Barney, and when the parson pauses
for breath, whisper to him to inquire for
one Matthew Durant!"</p>

<p>When Barney had gone on his errand,
Scarlett performed the official act of unfastening
the dainty package to appraise its
contents. "White neckties, doubtless," he
soliloquized. "That is what folk on the outside
are by way of sending their kin to pull
them through a Klondike winter. No, but
almost as bad: an embroidered cigar-case,
with jeweled clasp. Now I'm wondering if
the fellow it's intended for can always muster
up a pipeful of tobacco! Well, Barney,
what success?"</p>

<p>"Just at this present, sorr, the howly man
has got his teeth well into the Evil Wan,
but he tipped me the wink he'd find our man
the moment he darst let go. Oh, by the
way&mdash;I hate to decompose ye, Sergeant&mdash;but
here's a letther for yourself!"<span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>"A letter for me, is it? Now, who the
mischief would be writing to me?"</p>

<p>"The mischief it is, indade, sorr! 'Tis a
lawyer!"</p>

<p>"A lawyer!" Scarlett scrutinized the
name of the Dublin firm on the missive
Barney handed him. "Now I'd give something
to know what that means! I've always
lived within the law, and without a
lawyer!"</p>

<p>"Sure, that's your offence, Sergeant. Depind
on ut, that's phwat they're afther
charging ye for!"</p>

<p>"'Tis their inflated cheek, then!" Resentfully,
Scarlett tore open the envelope. "If
'tis a bill they're sending me they can go to
the divvle!"</p>

<p>"Faith, sorr, that's exactly where they'll
have ye! That's phwat they're afther
counting on!"</p>

<p>Barney watched his chief with affectionate
solicitude while the latter read, and,
crossing himself, began a prayer in which
pious invocations mingled strangely with
unflattering estimates of legal lights.
"Howly Mary, full av grace&mdash;&mdash; The dirthy
blackguards, I wish I'd lost the letther for
the lad! Blessed art thou among&mdash;&mdash; Bad
cess to yez, ye black limbs av an onreputable
body, if 'tis only nearer ye were,<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
or meself less far away, rest aisy 'tis outwitted
ye'd be intoirely, if there's anny
diplomacy in the fists av this Mick at
all. Name av the Father, Son an' Howly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phew!" At last Scarlett broke through
the stupor with which the perusal of his letter
seemed to have encompassed him. "Is
it I standing here in my five senses, or the
fool of a deceiving dream? Barney, man,
listen to this and pronounce on it. 'By the
demise of your uncle'&mdash;that's my uncle, you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sorr, your uncle is my uncle; and
many's the accommodation we've had off
him, thanks be!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this doesn't refer to that impartial
relative of all impoverished humanity! This
is, or was, the man who prevented my father
from being the eldest son and only child of
his parents! By his demise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely, sorr. And which av his qualifications
may his demise be?"</p>

<p>"The final one. Demise means death. Oh,
not the commonplace, every-day occurrence
as we up here experience it; it is applied
to those who have something of value besides
life to leave behind."</p>

<p>"Faith, then, sergeant, it's ourselves will
be immune."<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>"That's what I'm doubting. Five minutes
since, I was nobody of nowhere. Now I
suddenly find myself gazetted Sir Gerald
Scarlett of Dunshinannon, owner of a picturesque,
if ruined, castle; three acres that
might be profitable under cultivation, and
a cow!"</p>

<p>Barney shook his head. "A grand dream,
Sergeant. May the blissed saints soften the
awakening to ye," he added, with commiseration.</p>

<p>"But, man&mdash;here, look at this, will ye?"
Before his astonished eyes Scarlett held a
draft for a substantial sum. "A luck-slice
from the rent-roll. Oh, that proves it no
dream, since money talks, but never in its
sleep!"</p>

<p>Barney removed his regimental hat.
"Hurrah for Sir Gerald, the castle, including
the ruins, the acres, and ivery blissed
pertaty, past, present and to come, adorning
them!"</p>

<p>"And the cow, God bless her!" Scarlett
also bared his head.</p>

<p>"Amen!" Barney supplemented, fervently.
"I'm wid ye, sorr, in prosperity, as in adversity!
How soon do we quit the service,
me lordship?"</p>

<p>"Not till we've finished out our term, you
lazy vagabond! Meanwhile, sink the title.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
I travel on my soldiership, and you're in
the same boat!"</p>

<p>"Amen! if it has to be," acquiesced Barney,
with philosophic resignation, saluting
meekly. "And phwat's the next orders, me
lord&mdash;Sergeant, I should say?"</p>

<p>"For the present you can take charge and
administer the law, unless anything demanding
a judicial mind comes up, while I
wander on incog., and do a little prospecting
to identify the toughs and crooks that
give this the name of the blackest district
in all the great Northwest! I've begun
rather well; I've just rounded up Bully Nick
and his sharp-shooting gang!"</p>

<p>"Ye have?" Barney's jaw dropped with
amazement. "Single-handed?"</p>

<p>"Aye; but forewarned is four-armed, you
know!"</p>

<p>"Even so. Mother of Grace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, man; that's but a flea bite in the
ocean, as one of our Irish philosophers remarked.
There's a regularly organized
band of thieves&mdash;aye, who don't stick at
murder, either&mdash;that hold up stages, terrorize
the whole community, and play the dickens
generally. The scum of all nationalities,
their headquarters are across the boundary
in Uncle Sam's domain, while their field of
operations is the whole Northwest. The<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
thing is to identify them, catch them redhanded
in our precincts."</p>

<p>"A Herculaneum task, me lordship&mdash;Sergeant,
I should say&mdash;and more, since that
gintleman had only twelve impossibilities to
conquer!"</p>

<p>"Och, Hercules! I'd sooner any day be a
whole man than just half a god like Hercules!
Any able-bodied son of Erin should be
able to match Hercules, except in the snake-strangling
trick, since divvle an example
did Saint Patrick leave us to practice on."</p>

<p>"Thrue," assented Barney. "Many's the
dhrink I've laid on it that the only snakes
an Irishman is capable of behoulding is all
in his own eye."</p>

<p>"Don't ye be looking for them that way
on duty. Keep your vision for two-legged
crawlers. There was a fellow here, just
now, who, if faces are incriminating testimony,
stands twenty times convicted in the
dark, or I'm a duffer in face-palmistry."</p>

<p>"Why not begin with the rope's end, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"No, no, man! We must even make haste
slowly, as some old Roman of an Irishman
remarked. I'll just wander on, as if looking
for a job, and if any one inquires about me,
give me what character ye please!"</p>

<p>"Faith, sorr, since fair play demands<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
reciprocity on both sides, I'll damn ye for a
blockhead!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," laughed Scarlett. Breaking
off, he inquired: "Now who's this chee-charka
coming up the trail?"</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<h2><a id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="h3">LUCKY DURANT</p>

<p>The lagging pace of the young man
who was approaching, his weary
stoop under a light pack he carried,
miner-wise, upon his shoulders, confessed
him all too surely the tenderfoot Scarlett
had described him.</p>

<p>With a bewildered stare at the congeries
of squalid tents and cabins that comprised
the camp, he accosted Barney.</p>

<p>"Surely this can't be Lost Shoe Creek?"
"Maybe it can't be, but that's phwat it
does be, me lad!"</p>

<p>"It's so different from what I expected."</p>

<p>"Ye were anticipating skyscrapers? In
these parts we build downwards for gold&mdash;and
both ways lead equally far from heaven,
I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"Well, though not skyscrapers, I certainly
had looked for something more imposing.
Can you direct me to the office, or
residence, of Mr. Matthew Durant?"<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>"Durant!" Involuntarily, Barney and
Scarlett exchanged a glance of surprise.</p>

<p>"Office or residence, indade! 'Tis myself
would like to be directed to the man," replied
the former.</p>

<p>"Oh, but surely you know him!" cried the
newcomer. "I mean Matthew Durant,
owner of the wonderful Rainbow Mine!"</p>

<p>At this juncture the elderly man who had
been spoken of by one of his brother prospectors
as Lucky, came hurrying toward
them from the tent, and addressed himself
to Barney. "The Dominie has just announced
that you have mail for one Matthew
Durant, officer. I am he."</p>

<p>Before Barney could reply the young tenderfoot
had darted forward with a threatening
gesture. "You Durant, indeed, you miserable
fraud! I know Mr. Durant well," he
turned to Barney to explain. "I was employed
in the New York bank where he
keeps his daughter's account, and many is
the chat I've had with him. Why, I've resigned
my position and spent every penny
I'd saved to come out here to beg him to
put me in the way of making my fortune, as
he has done, scooping gold out of the earth.
The idea of this beggarly imposter pretending
to be Durant, owner of the Rainbow
Mine!"<span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>A sad smile crossed the worn features of
the claimant. "I must indeed be changed if
Walter Pierce does not know me."</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the young man
started, but gazed at the unshorn face, the
poverty-stricken figure, unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Ye have some means of identification,
perhaps?" suggested Barney, in all good
faith. "A strawberry mark, or a lock of
your sainted mother's hair?"</p>

<p>Durant thought a moment. "No one here
knows me by the name. But, wait! I have
a picture of my daughter Evelyn, whom
Walter will recognize. Evelyn will bear
witness that I'm her own dear daddy." He
felt in his breast, but not finding what he
sought, gave a smothered cry. "Lost&mdash;my
little Evie, have I lost you?"</p>

<p>"This is herself, I'm thinking!" Scarlett
held out the miniature. "I found her on this
spot, putting the wild roses to the blush."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you! Evie!" Durant
covered the portrait with kisses.</p>

<p>"Which was to be proved," remarked
Barney, conclusively, handing Durant his
mail. "There's a thrifle av duty to pay on
it, sorr."</p>

<p>Durant's expectant hand dropped to his
side. "I&mdash;I'm rather down on my luck just
now," he faltered.<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>While Barney hesitated between conscience
and good will, Scarlett whispered in
his ear. "Good!" he then exclaimed. "The
Sergeant will settle it, Misther Durant. I
mean," he corrected himself as Scarlett
kicked his leg, "it is already settled. Me man
here," he indicated his superior, "a great
blockhead ordinarily, but with lucid intervals,
reminds me that the duty was prepaid
beforehand in advance."</p>

<p>When the soldiers had moved away, Walter
Pierce found his voice. "Then you are
Durant. But where, where, where is the
wonderful Rainbow Mine?"</p>

<p>"Where it always has been&mdash;in the
clouds!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, do you mean to say it is
all a fraud?"</p>

<p>"Less that than a fiction," amended the
older man. "Sit here and I'll tell you all
about it." He sank wearily on the ground,
leaning against a huge pine tree, and when
Walter had placed himself beside him, began
his strange tale. "Oh, the money has
been no fraud, as your bank can testify.
I'm an old miner&mdash;a born prospector, with
a nose for gold&mdash;and I've always had
streaks of luck; I've always made my pile,
in California, Colorado, and up here in
Canada. But it has only been a rich pocket<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
here and there. I've never managed to develop
a proposition into a paying claim, or
a paying claim into an exhaustless mine.
But whenever I've had a big clean-up I've
blown it all in, as your born miner invariably
does, trusting to luck for the morrow.
Some miners blow it in on cards, drink&mdash;on
worthless properties&mdash;but I've had only one
extravagance&mdash;my daughter. My wife always
had vast ambitions, and when the wife
died she passed them on to me for our only
child. To educate Evelyn, to have her
brought up a flower of civilization, that always
has been my dream, as I have roughed
it in camps or tramped over glaciers,
through forests, sleeping under the stars.
And so I sent the little one to school in
'Frisco, Chicago, New York, with a European
polishing off. And somehow, the further
East she traveled the grander her notions
grew&mdash;and as for myself, on my flying
visits to her I took pride in seeing my girl
hold her own with the daughters of oil, beef
and railways trusts, and then with the
daughters of princes of the Old World. And
the luck held out. However grand Evie's
whims, I always had the stuff to back her&mdash;and
I always lived in hopes that any turn of
the pick and shovel would yield me, not
merely a rich clean-up, but the inexhaustible<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
fortune that is every miner's dream.
And so, between what Evie took for granted
and what I told her, half in jest, there grew
up this fable of the Rainbow Mine. But this
season&mdash;I suppose it is my punishment for
my deception&mdash;the luck has turned clean
against me. The gold is here in the earth,
as it always has been&mdash;but I've lost my
knack of finding it. The old earth no longer
trusts me with her secrets." He groaned,
covering his face with his rough, knotted
hands for a minute, during which young
Pierce exclaimed, bitterly:</p>

<p>"Then what is to become of me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" Recovering composure, Durant
rose. "It won't do to loaf. I'm sorry
for your disappointment, Walter. And the
worst is, I can't do much for you; can't
show you any hospitality. In order to maintain
life till the luck turns, I am sharing the
outfit of a chap named Blenksoe. That's he,
yon." He indicated a man of evil aspect,
who was lounging at the entrance of a rude
hut nearby. "Blenksoe is grub-staking me
through a superstition about my luck. But
Blenksoe is a bad lot. You must not have
anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"But what in the world am I to do?" cried
Pierce. "I tell you, I am penniless&mdash;penniless!"<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>"You must work," Durant admonished.
"You must get employment on a lay&mdash;that
is, you must induce some one to let you help
work his claim on shares. I'll teach you
the trick of panning gold."</p>

<p>"But if gold-dust can be taken out by the
dish-pan," cried Walter, with bulging eyes,
"why should any one go poor?"</p>

<p>"You young fool! First you have to find
in which patch out of desert areas of mud
and cobblestone the gold-dust hides. And
then you have to pay the Government for
the privilege of staking, working it. Look
along the banks of this creek. As far as eye
can see every inch of pay-dirt is claimed,
staked, defended, not only by law, but by
miners' justice, with a shooting-iron. In a
mining camp human life ain't worth a damn,
as you'll find if you trespass on another
man's claim, or if he should take a fancy to
yours. Just be content if, for the present,
by working eighteen hours of daylight during
the twenty-four, during the short summer,
you can pay your way."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" again cried Pierce.
"Then are the stories of gold all a fable?
Surely many fortunes are made up here?"</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Durant, "and lost here,
too. Every Klondike camp is the garden
for a score of fortunes, and the graveyard<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
of a thousand hopes. Well, I must go get
pick and shovel." He moved toward his
tent. "I must go out on the hills, prospecting.
Thank God, I left my girl a tidy sum in
the bank&mdash;and before that is spent her
daddy will have found her Rainbow Mine&mdash;or
will die like a trail-dog in the traces!"</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you&mdash;&mdash;" Walter detained
him. "That money&mdash;Miss Durant has
drawn it, every penny."</p>

<p>"Eh!" exclaimed Durant. "Are you
sure?"</p>

<p>"It was that which set me thinking about
coming up here myself. I heard her telling
the cashier. You haven't paid her a visit
for three years; accordingly, she intends
coming to visit you as a surprise."</p>

<p>"A surprise! My God!" gasped the unhappy
man.</p>

<p>"She has invested in the most costly outfit,"
continued Walter. "She is traveling
with a princely retinue. You see, she thinks
you live in regal style&mdash;palaces and all
that."</p>

<p>"And when&mdash;&mdash;" Durant moistened his
dry lips. "How soon&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Pierce shrugged his shoulders. "I fell in
with her party to-day, though as I was stone
broke and hoofing it I didn't care to make
myself known to her. She was inquiring<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
your whereabouts. She is coming by the
stage. She'll be here any minute now."</p>

<p>The tooting of a horn echoed through the
hills, mingled with bursts of girlish laughter,
as, with a crack of the driver's whip and
the jingling of bells, in a cloud of dust the
stage was seen approaching. With a groan
Durant buried his face in his hands. "My
God!" he muttered. "Evelyn!"</p>

<p class="h3">THE PICTURE GIRL</p>

<p>"Let your light so shine&mdash;&mdash;" At
this cue the much-converted
Ikey passed Gumboot Annie's
frying-pan about among the men. Instead
of organ-voluntary, or tenor solo, such as
obtains during the offertory in conventional
places of worship, the Bully, at his own request,
rose to make a few appropriate remarks.
"I ain't convarted," he frankly announced.
"Heaven ain't in it with a hot old
hell of a whoop-up time in this here life,
d'ye see? Even if ye hang fer it! But say,
parson, you're all right. You're a sure
square proposition! Boys, the collection
goes, d'ye see?"</p>

<p>"You betcherlife!" with cordial emphasis
acquiesced the boys, even as the orthodox
respond Amen, while pouring gold-dust
from their pokes into the frying-pan.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't despair of you, Nicholas! I
shall yet see you a pillar of the church!"<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
The minister now was mingling with his
congregation, shaking hands, hearty if not
invariably spotless, right and left. "Thank
you, lads, thank you! This will go toward
the maintenance of a hospital, where you
shall be cared for when disabled by accident,
or laid up with a er&mdash;touch of&mdash;ahem!&mdash;scurvy."</p>

<p>"Booze," corrected Bully Nick, scorning
the well-meant euphemism.</p>

<p>After a second, informal benediction from
Maclane, Barney, considering that the execution
of justice temporal had been waived
quite long enough in favor of things pertaining
to the soul, tapped Nick on the
shoulder with cheerful authority. "Now,
me man, put your best fut forward and step
prattily to jail! The rest av yez"&mdash;he
looked round on the group with impartial
invitation&mdash;"can accompany us on giniral
lack av principles!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but say&mdash;the stage is a-comin' in,"
remonstrated Bill, as the tooting of a distant
horn echoed musically among the
mountain passes. "There's like to be ladies
aboard her. Can't we wait for to look upon
the ladies?"</p>

<p>The suggestion obviously was popular,
even to the extent of suggesting mutiny if
not complied with, and Barney himself had<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
some difficulty in delaying his consent in
order to add value to it before permitting
his mug to relax into a grin. "As a man in
line av promotion to be nominated an officer
and a gintleman, 'tis no less than me duty."</p>

<p>"Boys, boys!" Mops, who had been reconnoitering,
ran back, breathless and excited.
"There's gals aboard!"</p>

<p>"The hell thar is!" exclaimed the boys,
delighted, and meaning no disrespect.</p>

<p>"A hull outfit o' gals," expatiated Mops.
"And one, perched up by the driver, jest the
swellest, jim-dandiest little female proposition
you ever seen in all your life! Say,
I wisht I hadn't left my dress-suit in cold
storage!"</p>

<p>"Any one lend me a comb?" Any one
being unable to oblige him, Bill ran a corkscrew
through his curly hair. "Well, anyway,
my face is clean!"</p>

<p>"All ye can see av it, for the dhirt that's
on it," Barney encouraged him.</p>

<p>The horn blew a gay fanfare; the driver's
whip cracked with more than wonted smartness;
the bells on its four horses jingled
merrily as the cumbersome old stage rattled
into Lost Shoe Creek, and drew up before
Gumboot Annie's hostelry to an enthusiastic
ovation of hurrahs, cap-tossings, and
gun-firings from the male populace.<span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>A handsome girl, wearing her modish
clothes with a too conscious effect of style,
from her place on the box bowed pleased
acknowledgments in all directions for the
cheering, but at the volley of shots gave a
little startled cry, which was taken up in
louder note by her companions.</p>

<p>Doffing his hat, Parson Maclane came forward,
with a reassuring smile. "Only a
Klondike welcome, young ladies," he explained.</p>

<p>"That's what!" the men confirmed him.
"A Klondike welcome!"</p>

<p>"How quite too utterly charming!" exclaimed
the young lady. "Girls! Sarah!"
she appealed to the others of the party.
"Aren't they too dear and picturesque for
anything!" That "they" were human beings
and not part of the brilliant panorama
seemed hardly to occur to her.</p>

<p>A score of pairs of rough but willing
hands stretched up to help the speaker from
her high throne, but the honor fell to Scarlett,
or rather was appropriated by that
masterful young man as, putting the other
aspirants aside, he lifted her over the wheel
and swung her lightly to the ground. Without
waiting for her thanks he returned to
his wood-chopping with a sense of one of
life's minor miracles upon him. "By St.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
Bridget!" he was thinking, "but that's my
picture-girl!"</p>

<p>When all the passengers had alighted
safely the boys pushed their leader to the
front. "Speech! Speech! Bully Nick!"
they insisted. "Speech!"</p>

<p>"Take my hat off fer me," in an undertone
commanded the champion shot and
orator. When one of his lieutenants had
hastened to comply, the Bully stood forth
and cleared his throat. "Ladies, in the name
of the district&mdash;and never mind jest at these
presents what name the district bears&mdash;I
regret I can't give ye the glad hand,
through bein' a-wearin' of th' Government
bracelets."</p>

<p>"The Government bracelets," repeated the
beautiful young lady, puzzled, under cover
of the guffaws with which his followers received
Nick's initial witticism.</p>

<p>"Mary, love&mdash;&mdash;" She appealed to the
tallest of the girls who stood about her.
"You are up in political economy?"</p>

<p>"I think he must mean some official
decoration," glibly prompted Mary.</p>

<p>"That's it," corroborated Nick, unashamed,
amid the shame-faced laughter of
his followers. "Official decoration fer proficiency
in gun-play!" He held up his handcuffed
hands.<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl and her companions recoiled
instinctively.</p>

<p>"My dears!" The minister stepped into
the breach. "I assure you, Nicholas here
has the warmest heart, though at times he
is a trifle&mdash;er&mdash;impulsive."</p>

<p>"Aye!" Nick nodded. "Impulsive, under
the influence of bad liquor. Shot a chap
recent when drunk, me and him alike. Not
but what he desarved it all right, though
the blamed Government won't see it in that
light. But never mind them little personal
details. Let me present the boys. Step up,
lads. This here is Mops, our masher. Only
hez ter look at a mess of pertatoes to rejuce
'em. Tuk a prize once at a beauty show,
there bein' no other contestants, and the
judge havin' been struck blind."</p>

<p>"Oh, stop yer joshin'!" growled Mops, as,
with a red face, he nearly lost his balance
in a bow.</p>

<p>"And Bill. Bill's our dude," explained
the Bully. "Won't use nothin' but fashion-plates
ter patch his breeches. Now, Bill,
don't turn yer back on the ladies, else they'll
see that what I say is true. And this here
solemn guy is Sandy, who keeps everything
that comes his way, except the Commandments,
and takes whatever he can lay hands
on, except a joke." A few more introductions<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
having been achieved in the same
style, "Well, well, I guess we're a rough,
tough lot," concluded Nick.</p>

<p>"Nature's noblemen, my dear," interpolated
the minister. "The dearest souls, except
for an occasional regrettable&mdash;ahem&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spree!" shouted the Bully. "But that,
take it all in all, is a good sign. When bedrock's
too smooth you won't find gold. Gawd
knows we're tough&mdash;but when women comes
among us&mdash;good women&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off
to pass a ragged sleeve across his eyes and
gulp. "They're welcome as pay-dirt, and
honored as queens."</p>

<p>"That's what! You betcherlife!" emphatically
assented the throng.</p>

<p>"Thank you! thank you!" replied the beautiful
young lady. "I must introduce myself.
I come from New York. My name is
Evelyn Durant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Rah, 'rah, for Evelyn!" shouted Mops,
to his own surprise and the general admiration.</p>

<p>"And these young friends of mine"&mdash;Miss
Durant indicated the six plainly dressed
little maids who were drinking in these wonderful
happenings, like children in a fairy
dream&mdash;"their names are Mary, Ruth, Ethel,
Kate, Effie and Gertrude, They have come<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
with me for a holiday from the institution
where they live. They are orphans."</p>

<p>A round of cheers was thereupon called
for, for Mary, Ruth, Ethel, Kate, Effie and
Gertrude, and clinched with Barney's flattering
assertion, "An' sure this is the idayal
asoilum for thim, and may they prosper and
multiply galeor, for divvle a family in the
disthrict can brag av an orphan of its own
at all, more shame to us!"</p>

<p>"And this," Evelyn tapped a stout, middle-aged
woman kindly on the shoulder, "is
my faithful maid, Sarah."</p>

<p>Sarah having been duly cheered, "Sarah
is nae bonny, but she micht be sonsy and of
a savin' disposeetion," commended Sandy,
cautiously, for which encomium, however,
he was only rewarded by an angry shake of
Sarah's stout umbrella, with a counsel to
keep his cheek to himself or she'd know
the reason why.</p>

<p>These graceful amenities concluded, "We
have come all this way to visit my father,"
explained Miss Durant. "But it is far harder
to find him than I should have expected,
considering how well known he is. But I'm
sure you can help me."</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried her hearers. "You betcher-boots
on that!"</p>

<p>"And who may be your dad, lady?" inquired<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
one. "Some crackerjack swell capitalist,
I reckon."</p>

<p>At this, a gaunt, elderly man, who had
kept in the background, leaning against a
tree, and taking no part in the proceedings,
shifted his position, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well," said the young lady, with a conscious
laugh, and the condescension of one
who might boast descent from Santa Claus,
"I suppose every one in these parts is familiar
with the name of Matthew Durant."</p>

<p>"Matthew Durant!" The owner of the
name did not claim it, and Scarlett and Barney,
who, of the onlookers, alone could have
identified him, recognizing the tragedy that
was being enacted before them, also were
silent. Meanwhile the prospectors, after
scratching perplexed heads and ransacking
memories in vain, denied all knowledge of
the man.</p>

<p>"Maybe he warks his proposeetion as a
company, leddy," suggested Sandy.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" Miss Durant flouted the
notion. "My father is It!"</p>

<p>The man leaning against the Douglas
spruce, his ragged cap drawn down over his
eyes, groaned slightly, and turning away,
looked toward the distant mountains, while
overhead a bird trilled blithely.</p>

<p>"Let me see if I can describe him," his<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
daughter was saying, in her sweet, assured
young voice. "He is tall, erect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Durant's bowed shoulders bowed themselves
still lower.</p>

<p>"He is clean-shaven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Durant felt his unkempt beard.</p>

<p>"He always dresses in the height of fashion.
He's quite a dude, I tell him."</p>

<p>Durant laughed outright.</p>

<p>"And I think him extremely handsome!"</p>

<p>"Sure; judging by his darter!" cried
Mops, gallantly. "Oh, I don't mean that!"
he hastened to add, fearful of having been
too free.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't mind your meaning it,"
laughed Evelyn. "But come, if you've never
met my father surely you all know his mine&mdash;the
wonderful Rainbow Mine."</p>

<p>There was a pregnant pause, and then the
Bully spoke, slowly, impressively. "I never
knowed an out-an'-out prospector that
didn't own the wonderfullest mine goin'&mdash;only
waiting fer a triflin' circumstance like
capital ter come along from the East and
open it up and put it on a payin' basis.
Why, every man Jack of us owns a placer
claim, or hydraulicking concession, a silver
or a copper mountain or a glut of gold or
summat that entitles him to be It. Why,
this here little beggar," he jerked his head<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
toward Bill, "he claims he owns an antimony
proposition that if developed ull make
J. Peerpunt Morgan take a back seat and
Hetty Green look like thirty cents&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No 'if' about it. You betcherlife it will!"
cried Bill, with warmth.</p>

<p>"Aye!" The Bully nodded his head, condoningly.
"And Sandy here claims ter have
an option on a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A copper proposeetion, pure boanite,"
elucidated Sandy.</p>

<p>"Aye! Something that's a-goin' ter make
Clark of Montana bust with envy some
day," assented Nick, "and knock Newhouse
of Salt Lake City inter a cocked hat. Why,
tho' by nacher conservative an' shrinking
I myself am calkilatin' on stackin' up the
chips&mdash;I mean the books, ag'in Andy Carnegie,
and pourin' oil on the troubled waters
of John D. Rockefeller's poverty, unless
he's run in fust! Take my word fer it,
missy, every man within range of them
bright eyes of yourn is a millionaire&mdash;ter-morrer!
A stun-broke millionaire!"</p>

<p>"But, you see, my father is a millionaire
to-day," explained Miss Durant, with
amused tolerance. "A multi-millionaire."</p>

<p>Nick shrugged his shoulders. "Lucky
father!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's his camp name," Evelyn ex<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>claimed.
"Lucky! He has often told me.
Surely you all know Lucky?"</p>

<p class="caption">MINGLED WITH THE TRAVELLERS AT GUMBOOT ANNIE&#39;S BOARD.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, broken only by
the fly-catcher's mocking refrain, every man
with wonderful restraint and delicacy avoiding
so much as a glance toward Durant.</p>

<p>Then, again, Nick rose to the occasion,
manfully. "Why, ter be sure! Everybody
knows Lucky, and Lucky's Rainbow Mine,
eh, boys? Blast yer, can't yer <i>say</i> yer
does?" he demanded, in an undertone that
would have been backed up with a shooting-iron
had his hands been free.</p>

<p>But of their own accord the boys, their
presence of mind recovered, all were loyally
assuring Miss Durant that Lucky and
Lucky's mine were synonyms for boundless
wealth at Lost Shoe Creek and throughout
the golden northland. "The mere mention
of it brings better fortin' than touchin' a
hunchback, or spittin' on your money at new
moon," one summed up.</p>

<p>"Too bad, but Lucky ain't here just now,"
the Bully went on to state, with an authority
that, handcuffed though he was, not
even the most audacious would have dared
dispute. "An' what's more, tain't so easy ter
locate him. Like as not he's off, attendin'
ter them vast interests of his'n somewhar
out among them hills!" He nodded, toward<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
the hoary-beaded mountains as if defying
their granitic silence to gainsay him.</p>

<p>"Sure he is!" corroborated the prospectors,
in a chorus, covering up the long-drawn
sigh of relief that nearly betrayed
Durant.</p>

<p>"Prospectors is here ter-day, and gone ter-morrer,
like the snow, d'ye see?" concluded
Nick. "But he'll turn up in time all right,
fer fair, with a pokeful of dust in his corjeroys,
and a train of mules loaded down
with nuggets fer his gal!"</p>

<p>"Sure! That's what! Betchersweetlife!"
cried the boys, who lacked their leader's
skill in improvising lies, but knew a good
one when they heard it.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you so much!"
Evelyn had begun to feel real uneasiness at
the continued postponements in arriving at
her journey's end or obtaining definite intelligence
of her father. "And when I join him
I shall tell him what a welcome you have
given me. And I promise you he shall back
everybody's proposition. I promise every
one of you a substantial slice of our good
fortune in the Rainbow Mine."</p>

<p>Comment on this generous pledge was
headed off by Ikey's vigorous ringing of the
supper-bell, coupled with an announcement
from Gumboot Annie that for a dollar<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
within the tent might be obtained a meal
calculated to turn the mother of the Delmonicos
the colors of a lettuce and tomato
salad from professional jealousy, on which,
at Evelyn's invitation and with Barney's
willing concurrence, the execution of justice
temporal again was stayed, while Nick
and his followers, with their custodian,
mingled with the travelers at Gumboot Annie's
board. There the Bully's manacled
efforts to devour bacon and flapjacks particularly
delighted the young ladies, who
took turns in cutting up his food for him,
while he himself was moved almost to tears
that his last victim could not be present to
share the joy their late unpleasantness was
procuring for himself as the survivor.</p>

<p>Durant followed them to the entrance of
the tent where, unnoticed, he lingered a few
minutes, listening to the hum of merry
voices, and feasting his sad eyes upon his
girl, then turned despairingly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<h2><a id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p class="h3">EVELYN ENGAGES A COURIER</p>

<p>While, as he knew, his identity
was suspected by Nick and
Nick's gang, yet, so long as
these were at supper his disguise enabled
Scarlett to wander through the camp, as if
seeking employment, and reconnoitre in
order to ascertain what were the most
flagrant examples of law-breaking industries
with which, officially, he would have
to deal. Meanwhile, his thoughts kept straying
toward the picture-girl with pleasure in
the thought of her fascinating proximity,
not unmingled with criticism of her large
assumption of little dignities, softened,
however, with pity for the bitter disappointment
in store for her when she
should learn the true state of her father's
affairs.</p>

<p>As it would be manifestly impossible for
her to continue under the delusion that hers
was the purse of Fortunatus to draw on, the<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
obviously wisest plan would be for Durant
to disclose himself to her without delay,
confess the truth, and either arrange for her
to remain with him, sharing his rough lot,
should she have the grit so to do, or take up
a collection to send her back to any friends
who might be willing to give her a home
until, if ever, his luck should turn again.
For his own part, however, both as official
and man, Sergeant Scarlett was strongly of
opinion that it would be an unholy act to
allow a bevy of girls to leave a district so
sorely needing them, above all when among
their number was the girl of girls whom no
young man can fail to recognize the moment
he sets eyes on her; or, as in his case, even
on her portrait. Accordingly, a thousand
schemes passed through his head for making
the wilderness, in spite of straitened
means and harsh conditions, an acceptable
habitation to the newcomers. The first step
was to take counsel with Evelyn's father,
but when, after making his duty rounds of
inspection, he returned to the neighborhood
of Gumboot Annie's hostelry, Durant had
disappeared, nor did inquiry reveal the
slightest trace of him.</p>

<p>Scarlett's next idea was formally to present
himself to Miss Durant and proffer his
services in finding her party suitable accommodations<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
till her father could be reached.
Just as he arrived at this decision the
travelers came from the tent. Approaching
Evelyn, with a military salute less effectively
seconded than he could have desired
by the battered apology for a hat that
he was wearing, he was about to accost her,
when, to his surprise, she waved him imperiously
aside.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, my good man. I wish
to speak with the officer."</p>

<p>At this, Barney, who was engaged in lining
up his prisoners for the march to headquarters,
came forward, with a flattered
grin. "Out av the way, ye hulkin' vagabone!"
he ordered his superior, with a rough
shove that filled Scarlett with wrath, and
sent Nick and his men, who every moment
were becoming surer of the equivoque, into
loud guffaws.</p>

<p>"I tell you, I never give indiscriminately
to beggars," stated Miss Durant, as the
young man seemed inclined to persist.
"Kate, love," she beckoned a serious-looking
young girl, "investigate his case."</p>

<p>Kate wrinkled up her conscientious eyebrows.
"His face is very red," she whispered
Evelyn, "but somehow I don't think
it's drink."</p>

<p>"Let him wait, then," ordained Evelyn,<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
"and I'll see about him myself. Meanwhile&mdash;oh,
officer, I want your help! I'm in such
a pickle for lack of a man servant," she
went on to confide in Barney. "The French
courier I brought out with me deserted the
moment we set foot in Skagway, taking my
camera, automobile, and I don't know what
besides. Of course, my father will see to
it that he's found and punished&mdash;and the
things don't matter, because, till my own
are recovered, they can be replaced. But
the difficulty is to replace Alphonse. I never
before saw so many idle and poverty-stricken
men in all my life; yet&mdash;it's the
strangest thing&mdash;no matter what inducements
I offer, no one is willing to take service
with me."</p>

<p>"Myself, I don't think it much loss, miss,"
Evelyn's maid struck in. "That Alphonse
was too tight-laced to be of any good use.
And, anyway, for my part I don't think it
respectable for a man to wear corsets any
more than for a woman to go without 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not Alphonse's usefulness I
mourn for," admitted Miss Durant. "It's
the appearance of the thing; the <i>chic</i>. My
father always likes me to have the best of
everything; and I owe it to his position no
less than to my own dignity to travel in the
best style. Officer," again she appealed to<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
Barney, "can't you recommend me a courier?"</p>

<p>Barney looked his bewilderment. "Is it
a currier for the horses av your automeboiler
ye do be wanting, miss?"</p>

<p>Perceiving in this breach his opportunity,
Scarlett stepped boldly into it. "May
I apply for the position? I'm looking for
work."</p>

<p>"Lookin' for throuble, more like," muttered
Barney, with solicitude. "Wid all
thim lasses! Begorra, I know the sect."</p>

<p>Evelyn turned about and surveyed the
speaker critically. "Ah, I'm glad it's employment
and not alms you want," she commended
the busiest, most hardworked official
in the district. "But&mdash;I wonder&mdash;are
you qualified?" Into her pretty eyes there
crept a look of doubt.</p>

<p>"I know something about horses," with
truth the Mounted Policeman assured her.</p>

<p>"But not about lasses," Barney anxiously
tugged at his sleeve. "'Tis them as leads
ye the divvle av a ride, and is like as not to
run away wid ye."</p>

<p>"H'm!" Evelyn considered the matter.
The shaggy picturesqueness of the prospectors
in colored flannel shirts, top boots and
corduroys, with hands ever on gun or pistol,
their odd phrase and lurid expletive,<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
touched the silly streak of romanticism in
her as had they been chorus of an opera in
which she found herself enacting the star
r&ocirc;le, but this clean-skinned young man, with
unadorned speech, in commonplace, work-a-day
clothes, at first failed to interest her.</p>

<p>"H'm! Well," she conceded finally, "I'm
something of a judge of people. Step into
the light where we can take a good look at
you."</p>

<p>As Scarlett obeyed, "There!" cried little
Kate, triumphantly. "The nice, modest way
he changes color, I'm sure he doesn't
drink!"</p>

<p>Evelyn also noticed, as who could fail to
do, the ingenuous blush that overspread the
white crescent of the young giant's brow,
and it flattered her woman's love of power.
"Well, girls," she demanded, in an audible
aside, "and what do you think of him?"</p>

<p>The verdict of the orphans was unanimous;
they thought him fine, Gertrude, who
would have been frivolous and slangy had
her institution permitted it, pronouncing
him "a peach." Sarah alone challenged him.</p>

<p>"He's a sassy piece," she informed Evelyn.
"Look at him now, fit to burst with
laughter at us! I never heard of a decent
man-servant that couldn't keep his face
straight."<span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>"But if I'm not straight-faced and strait-laced
like Alphonse," urged Scarlett, "at
least ye can count on me never to take
French leave of ye."</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head ominously. "He's
too young, miss," she warned Evelyn. "Far
too young."</p>

<p>"But I'm growing older every day,"
pleaded the postulant, "and up here the
days are so long, one grows old twice as
fast."</p>

<p>"He has too much command of language
for a man-servant, miss," insisted Sarah.
"That kind is apt to put on airs above their
station. And&mdash;look at him now!&mdash;there's
something altogether too masterful about
the way he walks."</p>

<p>"Ah, that comes from soldiering," the
young man explained. "Me legs are always
under arms, as it were."</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed with a distinct prepossession.
"What is your name?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Scarlett."</p>

<p>"Scarlett what?"</p>

<p>"It's what Scarlett."</p>

<p>"Eh? What do you sign yourself&mdash;that
is, can you write?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I manage to make me mark with my
fist on any human document that gets in
my way. I sign myself J. Scarlett."<span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>"Oh! And what does J stand for?"</p>

<p>"Gerald."</p>

<p>"Gerald! How do you spell it?"</p>

<p>"The usual way. G-e-r-a-l-d."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you sign it J?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just a mistake other people
make in the pronunciation," the owner of
the name elucidated, to his own if not to his
hearer's satisfaction. "It once nearly cost
me a lawsuit to establish it."</p>

<p>Sarah groaned: "He talks for all the
world like an Irishman."</p>

<p>"Murther will out," Barney proclaimed,
with pride.</p>

<p>Evelyn turned on the owner of Dunshinnanon.
"Are you Irish?"</p>

<p>"It's the best excuse my parents could
make for me," admitted Scarlett.</p>

<p>"I am more than half inclined to take him
on trial," Evelyn stated. "But first," she
again consulted Barney, "officer, can you
give the young man a character?"</p>

<p>"A character? Faith, but that's phwat
he does be needing some ginerously minded
person to bestow on him, for niver a wan
av his own has he to show at all, at all!"
cried Barney, mindful of his chief's earlier
injunctions to depict him in unflattered
lights. "Glory be! If I was to begin to tell
yez phwat I don't know about the lad he'd<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
be afther breaking my skull for me, an' not
for the first toime."</p>

<p>"Nor the last, either, you idiot!" growled
Scarlett.</p>

<p>"That's rather vague," commented Evelyn.
"Tell me, is he honest?"</p>

<p>"Gosh! th' Irish is no thieves," Barney answered
handsomely for his race, "though
now and thin maybe wan might snap at
something in your hand. It takes a dhirty
Hollander to do the stealin'!"</p>

<p>"Oh! And&mdash;is he sober?"</p>

<p>"Sober! A pure-blooded Celt like himself!"
Wishing still to carry out Scarlett's
first orders, Barney hotly repudiated the
charge of damaging sobriety on his behalf,
but warned by a surreptitious kick that he
was exceeding instructions, he softened it
by asking, generally: "Wid a felly like himself,
that dhrunk or sober is aqually an
omadhaun, phwat the divvle is the differ?"
And Scarlett also pleaded his own
cause by admitting that he was frequently
quite sober, though, thanks be! never to an
intemperate degree.</p>

<p>Sarah groaned portentously, but the missionary
spirit was awakening in Evelyn. "I
can put up with a good deal," she asserted,
"if I feel I am giving employment where it
is really needed. But I must first know<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
where I stand. Is this young person reliable,
to be depended on in an emergency?"</p>

<p>"You betcherlife on that!" yelled the prospectors,
in delighted chorus. As outlaws,
the mounted policeman was their natural
enemy, but for the time he had downed
them, as in the long run, they, by instinct,
realized he always would down them, and
they respected him.</p>

<p>"You stake yer bottom plunk on it, d'ye
see? He's the only man ever got me skinned
forty ways from the Jack," in a generous
climax conceded Bully Nick.</p>

<p>Evelyn's pretty face was clouded with
perplexity. Categorically there was no specific
charge against the applicant; moreover,
the longer she looked at him the more was
she impressed with the promise of strength
in his splendid proportions, the resolute
chin, clear, friendly eyes, even though the
corners of a mobile mouth did curl as if
with perpetual laughter in an outlook on
life too original to be seemly in a wearer
of livery&mdash;yet, evidently, something was
being withheld from her. Urged, however,
by all the little orphans, who by this time
were in love with Scarlett, she remarked:
"Yes, we must remember that we came up
here not only for our own pleasure, but
also to do good. I am tempted to take the<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
young man on a month's trial, and at least
endeavor to reform him. That is, if&mdash;&mdash;
Officer," she again consulted Barney, "is he
really the best protector you can find for
us?"</p>

<p>Pushing his hat back from a brow heated
by such unwonted drafts upon its thinking
powers, Barney scratched his head while
regarding his superior with disparagement.
Finally, "well, yis, he is," he admitted, as
if it were the last damnatory word to be
spoken of the man.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that something over
a dollar a day and his keep was as much as
he was used to in the way of wage, Miss Durant
instructed her new courier in his duties&mdash;"to
look after our trunks, bicycles,
banjos, pianola, mandolins&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the pets, dear," put in Ruth, who
was rather tired of trying to keep the peace
between an Angora cat and a canary, a parrot
that looked as if it had a wicked past
and a bull pup who wished to include the
parrot, past and all, in his present rampageous
scheme of life.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course the menagerie! Then you
must go ahead to engage the best suites for
us at the hotels, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And follow ye to pick up the articles ye
leave behind," Scarlett nodded, understandingly.<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
"But till we get fairly started, I'll
just accompany ye."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented Evelyn. "Sarah,
I hope you won't mind having the young
man eat with you while we are traveling?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it can't be helped, miss,"
gloomily replied the maid. "I only hope
the young man will have the grace to improve
the opportunity."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll improve it fast enough," promised
Scarlett, with a twinkling eye on Sarah,
"so long as ye don't expect me to embrace
it."</p>

<p>Evelyn cut short the maid's angry reproof.
"Now, Gerald, you must keep your
place. Conduct us to the nearest large city.
We must telegraph my father to join us
there. Meanwhile, we want to do a lot
of shopping. We want, oh, ever so
many things! Girls, which of you has my
list?"</p>

<p>"I put down prizes for our bridge parties,"
cried Effie, her eyes snapping at the thought
of the unhallowed joys in store for her.</p>

<p>"And materials for making fudge," whispered
Ethel, who had thirty-two sweet
teeth.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Evelyn. "And we must
buy presents: neckties and things for the
poor dear miners who have been so kind to<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
us. Also cotillion favors. As soon as we
are settled I mean to give a ball."</p>

<p>"But, miss, how about money?" Sarah reminded
her. "We have only fifty-odd dollars
left."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can have things charged!" cried
Evelyn, airily. "My father's name will be
letter of credit to any amount."</p>

<p>Scarlett looked about with a growing uneasiness.
The day was fast subsiding into
the long twilight that precedes the short
northern summer night. Barney had departed
with his captives on the long march
that was the most effective object-lesson
conceivable in what could be accomplished
in policing a district by but two men, with
the might of a Government behind; and
here was he, practically alone, save for the
minister, to guard these women, since, as he
shrewdly guessed, in an emergency the courage
of the other passengers traveling by
the coach would prove of negligible quality.
The horses had been put into harness some
time before, yet the driver kept delaying
their departure on the most trivial pretexts.
On this Gumboot Annie, when appealed to,
threw a lurid local color. "Guess Logan is
timin' things fer the hold-up."</p>

<p>"The hold-up!" in alarm, exclaimed the
passengers, who enjoyed these things better<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
on billboards forthsetting Bowery melodrama.
"You don't mean to say they really
have hold-ups in these parts?"</p>

<p>Gumboot Annie spat deliberately before
replying, "Why, that's our specialty."</p>

<p>"But the driver&mdash;does not the driver defend
his passengers?"</p>

<p>"The driver! Now wouldn't thet jostle
yer!" demanded Gumboot Annie of the
mountains. "Logan hes ter stand in with
the gang ter save his own skin. And, mind
you folks don't make no fuss. Pass in yer
checks an' no jawin', and the boys won't
hurt yer none. But if yer squeal&mdash;well, it's
none of my funeral."</p>

<p>Great consternation prevailed among the
passengers who had booked to Camp Perdu,
the stage's next destination, and elaborate
were the preparations they made to conceal
their valuables. The bills and gold-dust
Maclane had collected for his hospital he
skilfully packed into his moccasin, while,
to the general amusement, Sarah bestowed
Evelyn's ready money in the fauna and
flora of her own bonnet.</p>

<p>"It's my belief the woman only said that
to frighten us," decided Evelyn as, with a
flourish of his horn, the driver shouted, "All
aboard!" And as the stage rumbled peacefully
along she added: "In any case, our<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
party is safe. Our courier will protect us!"
In no respect, however, were her predictions
justified. Hardly was Lost Shoe Creek
left behind when from the bushes by the
wayside sprang a band of men, with hats
drawn over their faces, pistols in hand, bidding
the driver halt.</p>

<p>It was the most systematic proceeding in
the world, reducing the bandits to the level
of petty tradesmen, and their victims to
that of unwilling contributors to a recognized
if oppressive impost. Not one of the
former offered to spare the fair sex on condition
its fairest representative should
tread with him the stately measure of a
minuet; not one of the latter invoked the
memory of the former's spotless childhood
hallowed by a mother's caresses beneath
an old oaken bucket or spreading chestnut
tree. Instead, Logan wound the reins about
the whip as this stood in its socket, and
held up his hands, though without ceasing
to chew the straw in his mouth, while the
passengers under invitation apparently no
more coercive than that of the average trolley
car conductor to step lively or move up,
dismounted and stood with uplifted arms
while methodically relieved of purses,
watches and the like. Terror tied the
women's tongues, while the men, knowing<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
the futility of remonstrance, were silent.
Only Scarlett, while submitting with the
rest, ventured on a lively sally or so that
called down on him a few curses or served
to provoke a laugh that later helped him in
identifying the malefactors. But not a
word of importance was uttered on either
side till the leader of the gang, surveying
the pile of loot, muttered, discontentedly:
"Well, this is a blamed mean crowd! Go
over 'em again!"</p>

<p>It was then Scarlett took a quick decision.
Little as passivity suited his fighting manhood;
much as, in his own phrase, it pained
him to Evelyn's appealing glances to turn
a deaf ear, he knew that to offer the slightest
resistance would be to forfeit his own
life and leave the womenkind to a fate one
dared not think of calmly. Nevertheless,
when at the second overhauling he saw her
jeweled belt and studs torn rudely from her
he could not forbear a movement of impatience
that drew to himself the serious attention
of the robbers.</p>

<p>"Say, young feller"&mdash;one pressed the cold
muzzle of a pistol to his forehead&mdash;"air you
in an all-fired hurry ter see yer affairs
wound up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," he answered, "ye can
wind up me affairs and welcome if ye'll take<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
the time. They're just the Waterbury
watch inside me pocket."</p>

<p>The ruffian laughed, and told him he
could keep his worthless timepiece for his
wit, but Evelyn shuddered with a disgust
that gave her voice. "The pitiful coward!
When I took it for granted you would risk
your life for me!"</p>

<p>"Faith, but I'm not dying to be corpse at
me own wake," jeered Scarlett. "For a
lady I might risk my life, but not for the
dust the reverend gentleman is treading
under foot, nor for the greenbacks sprouting
from yonder good woman's botanical
headpiece!"</p>

<p>Shrieks from the women, groans and reproaches
from the men, denounced this
treachery, as the bonnet of the protesting
Sarah yielded up its riches and the minister
in heartbroken silence suffered himself, perforce,
to be despoiled, while old Blenksoe,
taken off his guard, in his natural tones
cried, approvingly, "Ah, thet's somethin'
like!"</p>

<p>As they hurriedly packed their loot,
"Rustle, boys," in undertones, warned
the leader, "else we shall have that
blasted M. P. of a Scarlett on our backs!"
His caution came none too soon. At Scarlett's
instigation, Barney had contrived to<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
get word to Perdu, and just as the robbers
had cleared into the jungle with their booty
an armed delegation of citizens appeared
upon the scene. As the victims were left
penniless, Dave Hastie, proprietor of the
Grand Hotel, offered them gratuitous hospitality
for the approaching night, a kindness
that was accepted only too gladly.</p>

<p>"But before we start," cried Evelyn, amid
general acclamation, "I wish to denounce a
coward, a poltroon, a traitor! A contemptible
being whose betrayal of those who
trusted him should not go unscathed. Creature,"
she turned on her smiling courier,
"have you no sense of shame?"</p>

<p>"Sure, but I have," he answered. "Never
a day passes that I don't blush for human
nature in the lump!"</p>

<p>Evelyn sighed, and again addressed the
delegation of Perdu's Law and Order
League, who, having missed the robbers,
were fairly spoiling with eagerness to kill
the next best man. "He never so much as
lifted a finger to defend us," she explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I did! All ten of them," he defended
himself, in injured tones.</p>

<p>"It's only what one might expect," Sarah
harangued the throng, "taking on a scallywag
without character or references. Practically
robbing miss here of every penny of<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
ready money she possesses, and damaging
this bunnet that I got at a reduction off of
a lady friend as has set up a swell millinery
establishment in Sixth Avenue."</p>

<p>"He delivered us to our enemies!" There
were tears in Maclane's voice. "He stripped
the sick, the suffering; turned into
channels of vice the contributions for my
hospital."</p>

<p>All agreed that hanging was too good for
the culprit, and some were in favor of lynching.
One consideration alone deterred them
from extreme measures, even while a rope
was being hunted for among the skunk willows,
sage and wild lupin by the road:
namely, the unpopularity of such punitive
proceedings with the Mounted Policeman
newly appointed to the district.</p>

<p>"Times is sadly changed, boys," the leader
reminded the delegation. "The gentlemanly
way with us has allus bin ter choke off a
traitor's last prayers with a hempen Amen.
But this blamed M. P. is as apt ter pinch
the gentlemen as acts impulsive in a little
lynchin' matter as quick as he'd pinch a
criminal. Thar's only two of 'em," he explained
to the travelers, "the Sergeant and
his man&mdash;but the way the feller covers distances&mdash;his
horse has seven-leagued boots
for sure! Now, as president of Perdu's<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
Peace Committee and Law and Order
League, I'd claim it my proud privilege ter
fit the noose ter this young rascal's neck&mdash;but
as husband to a good woman and father
to her kids I don't want ter run up contrairy-wise
agin Scarlett of the Mounted!"</p>

<p>"Very well," decided Evelyn. "I myself
am in favor of government. I belong to several
ladies' associations for upholding clean
streets and economy in the Mayor's office
and things like that. From what you say,
this&mdash;I didn't catch the Mounted Policeman's
name, but he obviously must be an
officer; and though with us, in New York,
policemen, even mounted ones, have no
standing in Society, yet, in his way, he must
be a gentleman. Then let this miserable
fellow be bound and taken before him for
sentence. I myself will press the charge
against him."</p>

<p>"Good business," applauded the delegation,
heartily.</p>

<p>But as they were about to bind the prisoner
with a rope taken from the skeleton of
a wretched horse that some inferior brute
of a human being had put to purposes of
transportation under conditions for which
nature had never intended it, the Irishman
put them lightly aside.</p>

<p>"One moment, please. Now that ye've<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
wisely decided to postpone suspending the
judged, also, as a famous American in a
crisis once remarked, suspend judgment.
All the accusations brought against me are
dead true, which is why ye are alive to make
them. I assisted in the despoiling of ye, on
business principles, sacrificing small sums
to one ten times their combined amounts.
For under my own right foot I carry a sum
that will not only replace Sarah's bonnet,
greenbacks and all, but also reimburse the
hospital with a little contribution of my
own to boot."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew a roll of ready money
from its hiding place and handed some
bills over to the astonished maid and the no
less astonished minister. "The rest, a draft,
I am commissioned to deposit in the bank on
account of one Durant, now absent on a
prospecting trip, for the maintenance, till
he returns, of his daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud chorus of surprise, admiration,
gratitude interrupted the young man who
was now hero of the hour.</p>

<p>The League enrolled him an honorary
member on the spot. To his terror, three
depressed women with bundles wanted to
kiss him for his mother, while Maclane, on
behalf of all the disabled people in the district,
nearly wrung his hand off. As breaking<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
away he started to make his escape, Evelyn
detained him. "My preserver," she
cried, in impassioned tones, "let me reward
you!"</p>

<p>And when Scarlett, laughing, shook his
head, refusing a moiety of his own ready
money that, at Evelyn's direction, Sarah
was proffering him, "Then at least tell me
your name&mdash;for in the excitement I am
ashamed to say I have clean forgotten it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," insisted the group, "your
name!"</p>

<p>"'Tis the same as it has always been," he
answered, blithely, turning on his heel. "I
haven't changed it yet. Any time ye want
me just ask at headquarters for Himself, for
Scarlett of the Mounted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<h2><a id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p class="h3">EVELYN SEEKS COUNSEL</p>

<p>A few days later Evelyn, accompanied
by Sarah, knocked at the door
of St. Andrew's Mission, near
Perdu. An Indian woman opened to her,
and on her asking for Mr. Maclane, the minister
came forward with a cordial welcome.</p>

<p>"I won't invite you in, since just at present
my study is in requisition as a hospital,
and in any case you will doubtless prefer
the veranda with its vista of the mountains."</p>

<p>"And your lovely garden," added Evelyn,
glancing at the beds in which vegetables
and ornamental plants were growing in orderly
profusion. "I never supposed that
cultivation was possible so far north."</p>

<p>"That is a common mistake," replied the
minister. "But it is the same with plants
as with people: wherever it is possible for
them to grow it is intended that they should
be cultivated; by which I do not mean that<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
we should take the nature out of them,
teaching them tricks and artificial ways; I
mean that we should improve the conditions
surrounding them, in order that their
natural tendencies and activities may have
the widest scope for beneficent purposes."</p>

<p>"And yet"&mdash;Evelyn looked up and down
the road&mdash;"you seem to be almost the only
one who recognizes these possibilities. All
the cabins seem to have been dropped in uncompromising
rows along the highways, as
if they were so many children's toys taken
out of cardboard boxes labeled 'Made in Germany'."</p>

<p>"Ah, most of the folk who come here are
so busily engrossed in spading up the soil
for treasure they have no time to till and
sow. Yet our short summer of long days is
capable of harvests that would yield pure
gold in a land of canned supplies, where
men get to long for green food as for water
in the desert. Metz, the pioneer baker of
Perdu, a far-sighted German, is raking in
the gold-dust that other men laboriously pan
out, by the sackful, simply by adding a fresh
lettuce leaf, or radish, to every plate of fried
eggs and bacon that he serves. Brackett of
Atlin is famous for the beauty of his poppy
patch that blazes like a banner on a dusty
mountainside, no less than for the succulence<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
of the turnips with which he regales
his friends, all grown on a tiny corner of an
auriferous claim that overhangs the sluiceboxes.
Dr. Milne of Dawson received a
prize for the tomatoes and celery he took
down from his far-north home to the exposition
in Victoria, on the occasion of the
visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Indeed, there was a story going the rounds
that on the third day of the exposition,
when the good doctor wanted to substitute
fresh produce for his own, which, by that
time had wilted, he could find none in Victoria
to match their size. And I myself am
not a little proud of my own sweet-peas."
He handed Evelyn the fragrant blossoms he
had been cutting as he talked.</p>

<p>"Thank you. They are indeed lovely. But
I must not detain you too long. I have come
to you for that which I rarely seek&mdash;advice."</p>

<p>"I am wholly at your service." Maclane
installed her in a steamer-chair and placed
himself on a bench beside her. "Some ethical
question?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! I am an Episcopalian,"
answered Evelyn, loftily. "Not but what
I am very liberal," she hastened to add. "I
subscribe to worthy charities of all denominations."<span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>There was charity without resentment on
Maclane's good brow as he merely said:
"Then in what way can I help you?"</p>

<p>"My troubles are all of a practical nature."</p>

<p>"In that respect, perhaps, I am not the
best adviser."</p>

<p>"But there's no one else in whom I can
confide. People up here treat me in the
strangest way. I never had such an experience."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"In the first place I don't know how to
manage about money. Sergeant Scarlett
has deposited several hundred dollars to my
account in the Canadian Bank of Commerce,
and as much more in the Bank of British
North America, yet this morning, when I
went to draw some, the managers of each informed
me, apparently on their own responsibility,
that I am put on a weekly allowance;
that I may only draw so much, at
stated times, and not a penny more. When I
threatened to withdraw my patronage, they
said that would be impossible till the account
was closed. I went to three lawyers in
succession to get out injunctions and things
against them&mdash;but not a man would undertake
the case. Oh, evidently all the officials
are leagued in some sort of a ring or another,<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
for when I went to the office of the
<i>Perdu Claim</i> and asked the editor to help
me expose them, he only laughed. In New
York, one or the other of the ten-cent magazines
would have jumped at such an opportunity.
However, that wouldn't matter so
much if I could buy things from the stores
on credit, but I find not a merchant will allow
me to run up a bill. 'Cash down; spot
cash for everything.' I never was so insulted
in all my life."</p>

<p>"I am sorry people have seemed inhospitable,"
began Maclane, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, when it comes to that," Evelyn interrupted,
"every one has been hospitality
itself. Even the bank people, while officially
they were insulting me, in the name of
their wives and sisters offered to put up my
party in some sort of fashion till we get
settled. Hastie refuses to charge one penny
for accommodating us till we find permanent
quarters, though he had the impertinence&mdash;I'm
sure he didn't mean to be impertinent&mdash;to
suggest that we could stay
indefinitely if we liked to work our way as
chambermaids and waitresses and dishwashers
and things. Even that impudent
editor offered to turn out of the wretched
cupboard of a room at the back of his office
where he lives, and sleep on a printing press<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
if we liked to go stay there. At least a
dozen families have invited us to bunk in
their stuffy little cabins till my father's return.
But that isn't my way of doing things
at all. I'm accustomed to having the best
and paying for it. Yet not a soul will accept
my note or give me one pennyworth of
credit. Just wait till my father hears how
I am being treated!"</p>

<p>"Ah, your father!" Maclane caught at
the idea. "A talk with your father would
clear things up immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But where is my father?
how to get at him? I ask, ask, ask. Everyone
has seen him quite recently. Every one
assures me he is in his usual perfect health.
Yet when I insist on knowing definitely
which path he took, every one points
vaguely north, south, east, west, toward the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Then, for the present, why not accept
that view of it?" the minister suggested. "It
seems to be a matter of general knowledge
that he is well, and off on a prospecting tour&mdash;and
to a born prospector, such as is your
father, there seem to be no limitations in
the way of time, space, endurance, when
searching for treasure. Only one thing can
be predicated with certainty: sooner or later
a man must turn up at some base of supplies<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
to renew his outfit. And then, knowing
your anxiety, the whole district will see
to it that he and you are put into communication
with each other."</p>

<p>Miss Durant moved her daintily shod feet
impatiently. "I'm not accustomed to waiting
for anything that money can procure me.
Why can't I send messengers flying to recall
him, in every direction where there is a
trail? One would think that hordes of these
out-at-elbow camp hangers-on would be on
their knees to me, begging for the chance&mdash;yet,
though I have notices posted up everywhere
offering a liberal salary and a thousand
dollar bonus, I have had not one single
application, not though I offer for security
the Rainbow Mine."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" Maclane looked at her
compassionately, wondering in what way
the bitter truth might be most gently
broken to her, and examining his own honest
conscience to know if his should be the
task. Before this was clear to him, however,
to his infinite relief he saw the handsome
person of the Sergeant, now clad in
full uniform, coming up the garden path.
"Why not take our friend Scarlett into our
counsels?" he hastened to suggest.</p>

<p>"What! That insolent young man who
pretended to take service with me!" Miss<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
Durant ignored the soldier's military salute.</p>

<p>"My dear," remonstrated the good Maclane,
"our friend is greeting you."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sergeant," cried Evelyn, with hauteur,
"I did not see you! That is to say, in
my world a lady does not see a gentleman
until she recognizes him."</p>

<p>"Faith, then, I'd best make myself invisible,
lest when recognized I mayn't be seen."
Scarlett turned to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, please remain," pleaded Maclane,
"and help me advise with Miss Durant.
Pending her father's arrival, she finds herself,
er&mdash;financially embarrassed&mdash;or rather
at a loss to proportion her finances to her
wants in the style to which she is accustomed.
Now what do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"The first word lies with you, Dominie."
His back toward the two, Scarlett had
seated himself on the veranda steps and
was playing with Telegraph and Wrangel,
who, after a series of critical sniffings, had
taken him unreservedly into their favor.</p>

<p>"Oh, not with me; not with any son of
man," hastily disclaimed Maclane, who
quite forgot that he had tried to throw the
responsibility on Scarlett. "First always
comes prayer. Take your troubles, my
daughter, to the Divine Footstool."<span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, of course," replied Evelyn, petulantly,
"I always say my prayers, and make
the responses in church. But just now I'm
asking you how I am to pay for daily
bread."</p>

<p>"Well," Scarlett considered, "I should advise&mdash;to
begin with&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've said well twice," Evelyn sharply
pulled him up. "Best let well alone."</p>

<p>"Pardon," retorted Scarlett. "Truth lies
at the bottom of my well."</p>

<p>In spite of herself Evelyn smiled, and perceiving
his advantage he went on: "After
all, well is the best beginning when you
can't find a better. Why not for the present&mdash;just
for a lark, you know&mdash;try roughing
it?"</p>

<p>"Roughing it!" echoed Evelyn, in dismay.
"Wouldn't that be a bit rough?"</p>

<p>"That's where the lark comes in," Scarlett
assured her. "And we'd all make it as
smooth as we know how."</p>

<p>"A capital idea!" Maclane slapped his
knee and looked toward the sweet-pea vines
as if calling on them to agree with him. "So&mdash;er&mdash;original.
Think what letters you can
write to your friends at home, Miss Durant.
And then that is the only way to get the full&mdash;er&mdash;bouquet
of a country, so to speak; not
from the tourist standpoint, but by living<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
the life of the people of any class who, by
their work, are making it."</p>

<p>Miss Durant frowned, pondered a little,
then smiled. "I rather like the notion. We
came here largely to do good, and it will
make the inhabitants feel more at ease;
bridge over the social difference, as it were,
if I adopt their mode of life. I really am
very democratic."</p>

<p>"Then that's where ye'll feel out of
place," Scarlett remarked. "Wherever the
surface is flat as a billiard table, as regards
conditions, all class distinctions being wiped
out, it's there that aristocracy begins. The
democrats insist on it!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can accommodate myself even
to your idea of aristocracy," Evelyn remarked,
ironically. "The first question is,
can we find a suitable dwelling?"</p>

<p>"I've been investigating," answered Scarlett,
"and I find at Lost Shoe Creek there is
an abandoned cabin ye can have rent free;
a really very decent affair 'twill be with a
little patching, which the boys will be only
too proud to lend a hand with."</p>

<p>Evelyn gasped. "And you call that suitable
for <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Scarlett shrugged his shoulders. "This is
the wilderness, my lady."</p>

<p>"My dear," interposed Maclane, "you<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
must remember that building is a costly
matter. Even unskilled labor, when you
can obtain it, commands five dollars a day.
Talk of democracy; no man here is looking
for a day's wage at carpentering, when any
turn of the pick and shovel may make him a
Croesus! Make up your mind to it that the
Sergeant is offering you the equivalent of
New York's most costly hostelry."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well!" Miss Durant condescended
to the cabin. "I suppose we can
have tents for the servants? I shall need
two women besides Sarah."</p>

<p>"Pardon, miss." At her name, the maid's
stout form appeared from behind the angle
of the veranda, where she had been conducting
a discreet flirtation with the waterman,
who with a bucket supported by a frame
on wheels and drawn by eight frisky little
huskies, supplied Perdu with water from
the lake at five cents the pail. "Do not
count on me, miss. When my month is up
I am looking to settle down on my own account."</p>

<p>"You are going to desert me? You are
planning to set up in business, Sarah?"
asked Evelyn, dismayed.</p>

<p>"Business!" Sarah laughed, scornfully.
"With men growing on the bushes, as one
might say."<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you are going to
get married?"</p>

<p>"Why not me as well as the next lady,
miss, and sooner than some, in a place where
ladies is valued far more for their practical
abilities than for mere youth and skin-deep
beauty. I am told that two French-Canadian
gentlemen, who are starting rival
laundries, came to blows about me in the
Pioneer Bakery last night; this gentleman
with the waterworks concession has just
passed some extremely gratifying remarks
about me&mdash;though my own preference is
for a Scotch gentleman with religious views
and a copper proposition. Dear knows one
needs something stable to tie up to in this
outlandish place, where day and night get
all mixed up!"</p>

<p>"But, Sarah," Evelyn laughed, "you know
you haven't changed your watch hands since
we left the Grand Central Station."</p>

<p>"Time is time, miss," stated Sarah, "and
twisting the hands of a watch don't affect
it. I've always heard that mining camps
was immoral places, and I'll answer for it
this monkeying-with-the-clock business was
invented by some scapegrace that wanted to
deceive his poor wife about the hour he got
home at night. But my choice, whichever I
decide on, won't take me in that way!" She<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
shook her umbrella with a mixture of coquetry
and warning in the direction of the
waterman.</p>

<p>Again Evelyn laughed, rather helplessly.
"And I have been so indulgent with you,
allowing you to gratify your crude taste for
colors, where any other mistress would have
insisted on black, serge or alpaca, with at
most for your bonnet a quill or wing. However,
I mustn't stand in your light, Sarah."</p>

<p>"You can't, miss," the maid informed her,
respectfully, but with finality. "As for deserting
you, as a married lady I shall only
be too happy to chaperon you till your
father gets back or till you settle down on
your own account. And to start with,
though my month isn't up, let me give you
a bit of advice as from one lady to another.
Policemen," she eyed Scarlett with disparagement,
"are all very well in their way, but
as from my own experience I know they are
apt to be triflers, particularly on promotion.
Measured by a New York figure of speech
among us below-stairs ladies, miss, I myself
wouldn't think of permitting an arm
with fewer than three stripes on it round
my waist."</p>

<p>On this Scarlett assured Sarah, to her
great indignation, that she, at any rate,
would be safe from his advances, his arm<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
not being long enough to meet her figure-of-speech's
measurements. When she had returned
to the waterman, Evelyn, recovering
from the indignant embarrassment into
which Sarah's advice had thrown her,
sighed: "Such an admirable maid! However
will my hair get dressed?"</p>

<p>"Do it yourself," suggested Scarlett. "I
always do mine." A girl in a red cloak just
then happening to pass by he beckoned her.
"I think after all I can find some one to do
your work. Come here, Gelly. Miss Durant
wants to talk with you."</p>

<p>Evelyn surveyed the girl's unkempt,
though now sober comeliness dubiously.
"She doesn't look very&mdash;&mdash; However, is
she willing, clean and honest?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," snapped out Gelly, irritated
by the inspection. "Not one of 'em. I'm as
bad as they make 'em!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me&mdash;&mdash;" Evelyn's
voice dropped to a shocked whisper. "Sergeant,
have you dared recommend me a
young person who is not&mdash;not virtuous?"</p>

<p>"But she has so many other virtues,"
pleaded Scarlett for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, "I
thought ye might give her a chance." He
appealed to Sarah, who had drawn near.
"Perhaps ye'll let me explain to you as
being the older woman."<span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>Sarah pursed her lips primly. "There's
some things I'll never be old enough to
hear."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, heartily," Scarlett
was heard quietly to say.</p>

<p>"I am by no means sure that I shall grant
it," replied Miss Durant, with a haughty
toss of the head.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was addressing Gelly here," he
hastened to set her straight. "I had no
right to let her be present at her own dissection."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Evelyn had an inspiration. "I
spend a week every Lent in a Settlement,
and we came up here to do good, so why
not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, look here!" Confronting her, arms
akimbo, Gelly let loose the coarsely expressed,
though not wholly unjustifiable,
anger that in deference to Maclane and Scarlett
she had been trying to restrain. "You
better just dry up on that good-doin' proposition,
else it ull be the worse fer yer round
these diggin's! I know yer kind. I was in
a Home oncet, and they came and sang to
us, sometimes in fine duds ter show thet
they regarded us like as their equals, which
is lies! And sometimes dressed, oh my! so
goody-goody plain, ter show thet rich folk
<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>don't reely care fer silk and sealskin&mdash;which
is lies! And then they sent me to a
convent, and the Sisters, they meant all
right, but they cheated the doctor about the
medicines they put in his prescriptions to
save money fer the Church, and kidded to
the saints about their souls. Souls! Shucks!
Thar was a missioner oncet who thought
she'd got a holt of me all right, all right. She
were a-prospectin' ter launder my soul and
show it tied up with baby-blue ribbons and
sashayed with sanctity as a prize sample to
the Lord. Want ter know what I done ter
her? Not a thing, you betcherlife! Only
smashed her face with a sody-water bottle!
Soft drinks, cos thet kind puts most heft in
the bottle and least ter the booze. See?
Now you better get busy and earn your own
salt, virtuous ef you're so plumb struck on
virtue, and ef not, anyway&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A firm hand on her shoulder cut her short,
as, wheeling her right-about-face, Scarlett
sternly bade her, "Come!" And, like a little
cowering dog about to be whipped for a victory
in which, while half ashamed of it, it
wholly glories, Gelly meekly followed him.</p>

<p>The color which the girl's attack had
driven from Evelyn's face came flooding
back as she turned reproachfully upon Maclane:
"And you never said a word to stop
her!"<span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>"Ah," replied the minister, "I have
learned that I always gain so much from listening
to the other fellow's point of view."</p>

<p>"But surely"&mdash;for Miss Durant was not
a little proud of her capacity for "emanating
gracious influences," as the dilettanti
of her kind were apt to phrase it&mdash;"surely
you believe in missionary work; in doing
good?"</p>

<p>Before replying, Maclane stooped forward
and drew back a spray of vine that was
spreading itself obtrusively over a little
pink-faced daisy making a sturdy effort to
look up to the god of light. "The best we
can do is to try to give created things their
chance. And in the end, my dear," he
patted Evelyn's hand kindly, "it's the missionaries,
the good-doers, to whom the good
is done."</p>

<p>"Gelly," Scarlett meanwhile was admonishing
his stubborn charge, "in all this lowdown
district there isn't a man so mean he
could be hired to tell that poor girl yonder
the truth about her father till we've made
her feel at home among us and somehow
fitted her to bear it. Now, Gelly, are you,
a girl that has known trouble, going to be
meaner than the men?"</p>

<p>Gelly looked at him. "Better hev yer uniform
let out fer the wings ter sprout," she<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
advised him, with unfeigned homage, if
with mocking tongue. "As fer thet thar
stuck-up piece&mdash;&mdash;" A rude grimace completed
her estimate of Evelyn, but in the
midst of it she paused suddenly, her ill-bred
thumb dropping from her saucy nose.
"I'm jiggered ef I don't b'lieve yer gone on
her!"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," answered
the young soldier. "I'll lock up your tongue
in jail if it disturbs the peace, but I'd so
much sooner put you on your honor, Gelly."</p>

<p>"Till next time," promised Gelly, "yer kin
let it go at that!" Then, as she went down
the road, she burst into loud sobbing: "And
I cud be decent ef some decent woman ud
believe in me!"</p>

<p>Maclane, who had been considering, had
a new idea. "I wonder if Chilkat Jo
couldn't be persuaded to help you, Miss Durant;
that is, if you feel you must have service."</p>

<p>"Of course I must," said Evelyn. "The
orphans have been brought up to work, and
make themselves useful, but they are my
guests, my partners in this expedition; and
naturally I cannot expect them to do things
that I should not do myself."</p>

<p>"Naturally," Maclane agreed with her,
more readily than she deemed politeness required.<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
Going to the door he opened it, and
called to some one within. "O Joseph!
Chilkat Jo!"</p>

<p>The trader, who had been enjoying the
hospitality of the mission, came forth with
alacrity. Seeing Maclane, "Godam you!
what do you want?" he asked, in tones at
once amiable and fraught with high respect.</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph, what expressions!" The
minister shook his head. "You see," he explained
to Evelyn, "like all the Indians, he
learned bad habits from the white traders
before the missionaries came his way. I
sometimes wonder, if any Indians survive
civilization, whether morally they will recover
from contact with the whites. But,
come, Joseph, our friends here are looking
for a handy man to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mally them, eh?" inquired the Indian,
nimbly. After a quick glance at Evelyn he
shook his head disparagingly. "Damn
pletty gal, but not good business ploposition!"
He then turned a considering attention
upon Sarah, and nodded his head approvingly.
"She all light. Fat squaw!
Skukum squaw. Not lightfoot gadabout!
Damfine cook, eh?" he inquired of the
maid. "Squat by fire, fly venison, leady
chiefs leturn flom hunting? Shake!" He
held out a covenanting hand.<span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>"What, me become the bride of a
heathen!" shrieked Sarah, horrified.</p>

<p>"Me no heathen," indignantly protested
Chilkat Jo. "Me swear, gamble, dlink like
hell, plenty wives, laise Cain, all same as
white man."</p>

<p>"Joseph, my son, I will revise your code
later," Maclane told him. "Meanwhile, this
is not a marriage proposition. Are you willing
to help Miss Durant here with her household
chores&mdash;as a favor, you know," he hastened
to add.</p>

<p>"Not as a favor at all," broke in Evelyn,
in a high, hard voice. "I wish to engage a
man-servant, at good wages; one who knows
his place and can take orders, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice died before the Indian's fixed
regard. "No squaw say to me, Mush! Get
up, there! like dog. Mush! Lie down like
dog. Me damn high muckamuck Skukum
chief!" Wrapping more closely about him
the blanket that, with a boiled shirt and
store trousers, formed his costume, he re-entered
the mission with the unsurpassable
dignity of his race.</p>

<p>Evelyn rose without a glance in the direction
of Scarlett, who had rejoined them.
"Come, Sarah. Thank you very much for
all your good offices, Mr. Maclane. I anticipate
the suggestion you and the Sergeant<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
are obviously about to make: that I cook,
wash, scrub, sew for myself."</p>

<p>"Considering the conditions of camp life,
my dear, it might be wise," acquiesced the
minister, as he shook hands.</p>

<p>"Just for a lark, ye know," murmured
Scarlett, pacifically, saluting. But though
her pretty lip trembled, Evelyn held her
head high and passed him without a sign.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<h2><a id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p class="h3">PEACE, PERFECT PEACE</p>

<p>Feeling that on her father's return
she could requite the obligation a
thousandfold, Evelyn consented to
remain with her party as guests of Perdu's
Grand Hotel while the shack at Lost Shoe
Creek was being made ready for their tenancy.</p>

<p>Perdu, lying on a large lake of the same
name, is port of entry, and base of supplies,
to the goldfields beyond. Being at that time
in the third year of its existence it had a
highly developed social and commercial life.
For in its initial season a camp is likely to
be a bedlam of frenzied maniacs shrieking,
Gold, gold, gold! The second season witnesses
a slump proportioned to the inflated
values of its predecessor. But if it weathers
to a third, then some sort of poise is attained,
as steady industries develop and
existence seeks a normal plane. The fancy-women
who flock wherever the nuggets are<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
thickest, now segregate themselves in a
secluded quarter of the township; married
men send for their families, while the unblessed
bachelor whistles "The Girl I Left
Behind Me," or pays attention to the schoolteacher.
On all sides one sees the effort,
sometimes pitiful, always human and
worthy, from the harsh matrix of the wilderness
to wrest a home. And then follow
the petty complexities of a miscalled civilization.
To Evelyn's surprise, after the first
warm tender of hospitality, she encountered
the same restricted social conditions in
Perdu that obtain in villages on the "outside,"
as the world beyond the mountains in
northern latitudes is termed. Women left
cards on her; heads of rival cliques warned
her one against the other; the wife of the
principal grocer planned a tea in her honor.</p>

<p>On a brilliant summer morning, without
cloud or shadow, mountains and valleys
alike lying exposed to a broadside of sun
that had been warming to its work since
four hours after midnight, Evelyn set out to
return the visit of the town surveyor's wife.
A short cut through the clustered willow
bushes brought her to the back door of their
cabin, where she came upon the hostess at
her washtubs, while from the doorstep the
town surveyor was cleaning his teeth publicly.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
Wholly unembarrassed, the good
people greeted their visitor with cordiality,
and conducted her into the living-room,
where babies, cot beds and cooking commingled
with such observances of decency
and taste as a woman of refinement, no
matter how overworked, seems somehow
generally able to contrive. In point of cultivation,
so Evelyn soon discovered, her new
acquaintances were fully her equal. Delighted
as they professed themselves to be
that her stay would be of long duration, yet
to the plans she outlined for her projected
improvement of the district they showed an
almost marked indifference. When she
dropped hints about the free library she intended
to establish, Mr. Grayson began
quite inappositely to brag of having made
more money the previous winter by lumbering
than in the way of his profession, owing
to the fact that "up here, thank God! no one,
man or woman, loses caste by honest labor
of any sort." When she alluded to the art
furniture she thought of importing for her
domicile, Mrs. Grayson cautioned her to be
very careful of her lamp chimneys, the commonest
kind costing fifty cents at local
stores, because, so the storekeepers said, of
the exorbitant freight rates that prevailed.
Also she advised Evelyn to start right in and<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
do her own washing, as the local laundries
charged something over four dollars for
a dozen simple pieces. When Miss Durant
mentioned the theatre she was arranging to
have built, the opera troupe with which she
already was negotiating for a series of performances
to beguile the long Klondike
winter, the Graysons merely said, almost
with sarcasm, "How nice!" adding that the
camp contrived to get up some fair entertainments
of its own in the hall over the
truckman's stable. Coming to the conclusion
that they were jealous lest her advent
should undermine the social prestige which,
so Hastie had informed her, they enjoyed,
Evelyn rose to take her leave and, kindly
wishful to put them at their ease, admired
the babies, the bearskin rugs, the horns of
mountain sheep and goat upon the wall, the
view, the two geraniums in pots upon the
window-sill; accepted an invitation to a
wild-strawberry picnic, offered to teach
them bridge, and departed in a glow of self-gratulation
at her tact in dealing with the
envious and small-minded.</p>

<p>On the hotel piazza she found the minister
waiting for her, and with him Scarlett.
To the latter she had not spoken since the
day of their difference, for such she chose to
consider it, in regard to Gelly. True, more
<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>than once she had caught sight of him galloping
down the road or striding by on some
official errand, but never had she lifted a
finger to delay him, nor he appeared conscious
of her presence.</p>

<p class="caption">DEPARTED IN A GLOW OF SELF CONGRATULATION AT HER TACT.</p>

<p>Ignoring his greeting, in high good humor
with herself and all the world, Evelyn
opened fire. "Mr. Maclane, I wish you
would tell that young man he owes me an
apology."</p>

<p>Scarlett suppressed a gratified smile.
"Mr. Maclane, will ye convey to the speaker
that she'll have to prove the debt for me to
pay it?"</p>

<p>"Tell him the last time we met he put me
in the wrong," said Evelyn, prettily, the
glow of her goodness toward the envious
Graysons still upon her. "He behaved as
though he thought me narrow, contemptible&mdash;and
the worst is, the shoe pinches, because
in a tiny degree I fear it may have
been true."</p>

<p>She waited with a charming air of penitence
for contradiction, but, to her astonishment,
none came.</p>

<p>Instead, "I'm a brute, just," Scarlett remorsefully
described himself. "Who am I
to hold ye up the looking-glass? I'll never
be so rude again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p><p>"Oh"&mdash;Miss Durant stiffened perceptibly&mdash;"I
do not usually find the reflection unbearable
to contemplate."</p>

<p>"I've lived so long in the open, in primitive
conditions," Scarlett, unmindful of her
interruption, went on, "I always blurt out
whatever pops into my mind. Well, there's
precedent. In Eden, Adam must have called
a spade a spade."</p>

<p>"Ah, my young friend, but there's no
record of his having called Eve a spade,"
observed Maclane, with a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>"Faith, I'll drop the spade, then," laughed
the Irishman, "if she'll let me call her Eve!"</p>

<p>"Tell him," laughed Miss Durant, with
heightened color, "that he goes too far."</p>

<p>"Tell her I'd go farther&mdash;to any lengths,
for her, so long as it didn't take me from
her side."</p>

<p>"Tell him he's kissed the blarney-stone."</p>

<p>"Tell her I only practiced on it to keep
my hand in till she should come."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" cried Evelyn, feeling
that she ought to be very angry.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my children, peace," prescribed
Maclane. "Miss Durant, I am here
as a petitioner. One of my dear Indians, in
fact the sister-in-law of Chilkat Jo, has a
baby&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Velly damfine Clistian baby!" interpolated<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
the trader, who was sitting on the
step near by, whittling out a toy canoe.</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph!" the minister protested,
"when will you learn that a damn baby cannot
be a Christian baby&mdash;nor a Christian
baby a damn baby. We are to baptize the
little one this morning," he told Evelyn.
"And I am asked to beg you to stand godmother."</p>

<p>"For a heathen unregenerate, miss!"
Sarah put her head out of the window just
behind the group. "Don't you mix yourself
up with that truck!"</p>

<p>"I'm a bit of a heathen nowadays myself."
Maclane stopped Chilkat Jo's angry outburst.
"My dear Indians have converted me."</p>

<p>"I wonder you aren't afraid of being tried
for heresy, sir," commented Sarah, "talking
that loose way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should be," agreed Maclane,
"in the cities across yon mountains. But
here they hold us in a charmed circle, and
who can escape their spell?" He pointed to
the lake, brilliantly ablaze, like a vessel
holding wondrous depths of color, in which
the snow-capped peaks with their V-shaped
crevasses lay mirrored like cameos in turquoise
relief. "My Indians&mdash;in my civilized
days I used to preach hell-fire to them, till
they scorned me for it, crying, 'Our children<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
when they die become birds of song. Why,
then, should we give them to you Christians
to be burned?' Then, again, though I knew
him to be a saint, dedicated in Christ's
name to the service of his fellow-men, I used
to avoid my brother, the Catholic priest, because
his doctrines on the surface differed
from my own! Again, my Indians taught
me, scoffing, 'If Christianity makes enemies
of her ministers, why, we want none of it.'
Yes, all that I have given the heathen have
they requited me a hundredfold, making me
a Christian through the Christ I try to show
to them!"</p>

<p>"I will do what you ask me only too
gladly, Mr. Machine!" cried Evelyn, understanding
that this was the good minister's
way of making peace between herself and
Chilkat Jo. "I shall be proud of my godchild;
and I promise it the finest cup from
Tiffany's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! No presents, please," enjoined
Maclane. "Only kindness, neighborliness,
and an appreciation of the heathen virtues.
The Sergeant here has consented to be godfather."</p>

<p>"The Sergeant!" involuntarily exclaimed
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Aye! In the short time he has been in
charge, he has completely won the hearts of<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
the tribe of Raven and Frog. No baptism
complete without him."</p>

<p>"Oh, as a sponsor, I'm painting the town
red," admitted the Irishman. "And the
Claim has a regular column of feeble-minded
puns upon the epidemic. Well, I
only hope the Scarlett creepers won't turn
to Scarlett runners, in time of battle."</p>

<p>"I will tell Lallah that you consent. Be
ready, both, please, when you hear the
chapel bell," directed the minister, going
to the mission.</p>

<p>Scarlett lingered, but as Evelyn took no
notice of him, "Thankee for the pressing invitation,"
he remarked, drawing up a chair
and seating himself beside her. "And are
ye beginning to feel acclimated among us
savages?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are doing your best!" Evelyn assured
him. "Though I must say, even for
the wilderness, the ideas of social distinction
seem curiously lax. Why, as his head
waiter is off on a spree, Mr. Hastie has offered
me the place&mdash;three hundred dollars
a month and tips!"</p>

<p>"Good pay," commented Scarlett. "Why
don't ye take it? I'd ask no better for my
own sister, if I had one."</p>

<p>Evelyn tossed her head. "To pass dishes
to unwashed barbarians in corduroys who<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
gobble off their knives and drink from their
saucers. Even for your own sister," she
could not forbear asking, "wouldn't you
consider the situation rather primitive?"</p>

<p>"I should, and that's the situation's saving
grace," he promptly replied, "since
primitive man is woman's best friend, once
she makes him realize she will not let him
be her enemy."</p>

<p>Against her will, Evelyn looked at the
speaker with reluctant admiration, forced
to recognize that however ignorant of class
distinctions the poor young man might be,
his was certainly no ordinary mentality.
Accordingly, woman-like, she harked back
to personalities, hoping in shallow waters
to take him, through his very superiority, at
a disadvantage. "Oh, we have nothing to
complain of on the score of friendliness,"
she laughed. "Our matrimonial opportunities
seem limited only by the number of
single men within proposing radius. No,
Sergeant, I am not the belle. That proud
position is disputed by Sarah and the plainest
orphan, who also is the most muscular,
because they frankly tell us, in a land where
hired labor is not to be had a man must
marry to get some one to cook and wash for
him. However, such few score of proposals
as have come my way, I honestly can brag,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
are for myself, since I am not considered
a specially useful 'household proposition,'
and oddly enough my great wealth seems
not to impress these poverty-stricken millionaires
in the least degree."</p>

<p>"Oh, I tell ye, in a mining camp one gets
down to first principles, or lack of them,"
commented the soldier. "It's chaos, till
man and woman together evolve a paradise."</p>

<p>Evelyn waited, hoping he also would propose
to her in order that she might refuse
him, not kindly, with the consideration she
had shown the other poor victims who had
laid their hearts at her feet, but with scathing
denunciation of his insolence. Instead
of improving his opportunity, however, the
soldier rose. "Ye'll bid me to the wedding,
Miss Durant?"</p>

<p>"In what capacity&mdash;officially, or as a
guest?"</p>

<p>"Not as a mourner, that I swear."</p>

<p>"I may decide to elope."</p>

<p>"Impossible! In my bally those that
want a marriage license have to come to
me."</p>

<p>"I've always had a leaning toward the
nobility," remarked Evelyn, rather maliciously.
"Are there no men of title in the
camp?"<span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>"A handful or so of younger sons," Scarlett
informed her, "and a pathetic lot in the
main they are. 'Remittance Men,' we call
them, because they are on allowance to stay
away from home, avowedly that in a new
country they may turn over a new leaf, but
in reality that their families may be spared
the shame of witnessing their final disintegration.
Be good to such when ye come
across them, Miss Durant, for the sake of
what they ought to be, but don't marry
them, for the whole lot of them together
wouldn't make one decent man."</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed, but her face crimsoned.
"Dear, dear! And suppose, after all, you
disapprove my choice?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I'll exercise my official prerogative
and take ye in charge myself! Meanwhile,
I must turn my attention toward yonder
suspect." He indicated a person with
the deportment of a personage, who, dressed
in the height of fashion, was strolling, tourist-wise,
kodak in hand, down the village
street.</p>

<p>"Why, who can that be?" Evelyn leaned
forward with interest.</p>

<p>"That's my own question. He travels
under the name of the Count St. Hilaire."</p>

<p>"There's something very familiar about
his appearance. I wonder if I mayn't have<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
met him at Newport, or Washington. If
so, bring him here that I may renew the acquaintance,
Sergeant, please."</p>

<p>"I'll search his title first." Scarlett ran
down the veranda steps. "Now look out for
trouble," he muttered to himself, seeing the
stranger pause opposite a cottage in the
Indian quarter, and level his camera at the
totem-pole in front of it.</p>

<p>A crowd of angry Indians who had been
squatting on mats in the sunshine, making
moccasins and weaving baskets, instantly
rose and swarmed about him, vehemently
protesting in Chinook against this insult to
their sacred emblems, Chilkat Jo acting as
interpreter.</p>

<p>"Shame, shame, cursed shame to photoglaph
the Laven and the Flog!" he cried,
alluding to the totem's tribal device. "Velly
godam Clistian shame!"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Scarlett, impartially, interposing
his tall form between the evidently
frightened foreigner and the avenging
group.</p>

<p>"Mais&mdash;ze Klondike barber-pole&mdash;I no
steal him; je vous jure, gendarme! I make
ze photographie!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but unless you pay them for it to
show your good will, the Indians think you
are marking them for death," the Sergeant<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
instructed him. "All right, honest Injun,"
he in turn assured the crowd. "Only sun-picture.
Big man pay you big money."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Evelyn's astonished
voice at Scarlett's elbow, "it is my courier,
Alphonse&mdash;he has let his beard grow! That
is the kodak he stole from me!"</p>

<p>"Sacr&eacute; papier, ze mademoiselle!" shrieked
the man, recognizing her; and off he set as
fast as his trembling limbs could carry him,
Scarlett, reinforced by the children of the
Raven and the Frog, in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"It's only what you might have expected,
miss," remarked Sarah, consolingly, as in
mortified silence Evelyn returned to the veranda.
"The French is a deceitful nation.
They always have to talk in a foreign language
so you can't understand 'em."</p>

<p>"It's all right!" Flushed and breathless,
Scarlett came up. "He ran plump into Barney's
arms. Here's your camera, Miss Durant.
Later I'll get you to appear against
the Count&mdash;just a formality, you know."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort!" declared
Evelyn loftily. "Instead, you can fine me
any amount you please for contempt of
court. You doubtless will enjoy doing it!
As for the kodak, you can give it back to
Alphonse. I shall never touch it again!"</p>

<p>"Miss, you are ungrateful," Sarah reproved<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
her, "and the young man wounded in
the fracas!"</p>

<p>"Wounded!" cried Evelyn, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh," disclaimed Scarlett, who was shaking
his fingers as if to cast a pain from them,
"it's nothing. Only in protecting the
Count's beauty from an irate populace I
gave my wrist a twist."</p>

<p>"Oh, a sprained wrist is nothing to boast
of," derided Miss Durant.</p>

<p>"That's why I wasn't boasting of it."
Scarlett turned to go.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless"&mdash;Evelyn put a detaining
hand lightly on his arm&mdash;"I took a course in
First Aid to the Injured to fit myself for this
life, and I know that a sprain ought to be
treated with something, for fear something
or other should set in. Sarah," she asked in
a whisper, "what treatment does one give a
sprain?"</p>

<p>"Fermentation," prompted the maid, sagaciously.</p>

<p>"That's it: fomentation! Please, Sarah,
go fetch me&mdash;whatever one needs for fomentation."</p>

<p>"Believe me, it is not necessary." Scarlett
gave his hand another shake. "It soon
will be all right."</p>

<p>"Sit here!" Evelyn motioned him, peremptorily,
to a chair beside her. "No, on<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
this side. A soldier's first duty should be to
obey."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my arms are ever at your service,
even in times of peace." Scarlet
leaned back, luxuriously, as she rolled up
his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Of course, you understand I should do
this for anybody," observed Evelyn, sponging
his wrist with the warm water Sarah
had provided.</p>

<p>"Of course, ye understand I should fight
in defence of anybody's property," he
matched her. "'Tis for that I draw my
pay."</p>

<p>"Is it tender?" inquired Evelyn, pillowing
his hand upon her lap and dabbing it softly
with a towel.</p>

<p>"Tender's not half the word for it." The
patient turned his face aside. "It's the limit
of tenderness, and has to be treated on the
homeopathic principle."</p>

<p>"Miss, he makes light of it!" cried Sarah,
who, under a harsh exterior, was, by nature,
kind. "But his poor brow is simply
wrung with anguish." She mopped the
beads of perspiration that stifled mirth had
brought upon the Sergeant's comely forehead.</p>

<p>"Let us talk of other things to distract
him," ordained Evelyn. "Come, Sergeant,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
tell us all about yourself. Begin at the very
beginning."</p>

<p>"Faith, like most babies," he complied, "I
began by being the child of my parents."</p>

<p>"Poor but honest folk, no doubt. Go on!"</p>

<p>"They died before my remembrance of
them. I infer the honesty and inherit the
poverty. I was brought up by an aunt and
uncle, who didn't want me. One time when
I came home from school for the holidays
my aunt just looked up from her novel and
remarked, 'Oh, Jerry, how dirty you are!'
So I ran away to make my fortune."</p>

<p>"Which consists of something over a dollar
a day and your keep."</p>

<p>"And the prospect of a pension for my
widow."</p>

<p>"Your widow!" Evelyn dropped the hand
she was engaged in bandaging. "I didn't
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't got one yet," Scarlett hastened
to assure her. "But I shall, please
God, if I live long enough."</p>

<p>"Sergeant, you are talking nonsense,"
said Evelyn. "Pain has made you flighty."</p>

<p>"'Way up in the seventh heaven," assented
Scarlett. "Don't be so cruel as to
call me down."</p>

<p>"There!" Having stuck a final pin in the
handkerchief she had bound about the<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
wrist, Evelyn folded the soldier's arm
across his breast. "Sarah, go fetch me another
sash, will you? I'm going to use this
one for a sling."</p>

<p>"Which color shall I get you, miss?"
asked the maid, preparing to obey.</p>

<p>Evelyn shrugged her shoulders with indifference.
"I don't care&mdash;though I should
think your own taste would lead you to see
that blue goes best with this frock. There,
Sergeant"&mdash;having made a creditable cradle
of the ribbon for the soldier's arm and knotted
it behind his neck, she came in front of
him and surveyed her work admiringly&mdash;"that
will do, I think. Now, remember, it
must not be unbound for four and twenty
hours. Promise! I wish you would stop
laughing in that silly way and tell me if it
feels all right, really."</p>

<p>"Joyous, beyond words," Scarlett affirmed.
"I only wish I were that chap in the
mythology with a hundred hands&mdash;and every
blessed one of them in need of fomentation."</p>

<p>"I suppose you say these inane things to
me because you think me incapable of appreciating
sense," commented Miss Durant.
"Just because all my poor little efforts to do
good up here have seemed superfluous. Oh,
yes"&mdash;she checked the protest that rose to
his lips&mdash;"you all have been kindness personified,<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
but I do not think you quite understand
me," she complained, with the injured
quaver of one who at heart knows herself to
be understood only too well. "I'm really not
such an overbearing, ill-natured girl; only,
I acknowledge, a wee bit spoiled. You see,
after my mother died, when I was still a
very small child, in Colorado, my father sent
me to a fashionable school in San Francisco,
and there I began to feel that in Colorado
we had been quite savage. Then, in my
early 'teens I was put at another still more
fashionable school in Chicago, where I was
made to feel that in San Francisco I had
been hopelessly Western. Next, I moved on
to an ultra-fashionable school in New York,
where it was tacitly impressed on me that in
Chicago we had been positively vulgar.
After this came a course of Dresden,
Vienna, London, Paris, by which I realized
that in New York I had been provincial,
crude. On my return I felt myself cosmopolitan,
a finished product. Yet, in this
short space up here you all have made me
wonder if, after all, all the time, I have not
been a bit of a snob. Yes, you can't contradict
me. I know. A thoroughbred would
have taken things as she found them&mdash;would
be at home anywhere, while I&mdash;&mdash;"
Having amazed herself far more even than<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
her hearer by this unexpected burst of confidence,
Miss Durant amazed herself still
more by an unexpected burst of tears.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" Scarlett compassionated
her, while liking her thoroughly for her candor.
"Dear, dear little Evelyn, it's libelling
yourself you are, although it's true, and
that's the sweetest part of it. Here, take
mine!" As she was hunting, between inconsolable
sniffs, for the handkerchief with
which she herself had bandaged him, he tendered
her his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, the sprain&mdash;your wrist!" cried Evelyn,
in alarm.</p>

<p>"That's all right," Scarlett reassured her,
while drying her eyes with the hand he had
removed for the purpose from the sling. "It
was the other one that got the twist."</p>

<p>Evelyn drew back. "You mean you dared
let me bind up the wrong one?"</p>

<p>"Ye made your own selection," Scarlett
reminded her, in tones he vainly tried to
render penitent.</p>

<p>"That you did, miss," corroborated Sarah,
coming from the hotel with the blue sash
and tying it about Evelyn's slender waist.</p>

<p>"Give me back my ribbon, my handkerchief!"
demanded Evelyn of Scarlett, furiously.</p>

<p>"Not for four and twenty hours," he answered.<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
"Not even for you would I break
a promise to a lady."</p>

<p>"Never, never, never will I speak to you
again!" cried Miss Durant.</p>

<p>Just then the chapel bell began to ring
merrily, and at the same moment Maclane
hurried toward them from the mission, an
open hymnal in hand. "Come, my children,
we march in, singing," he explained, pointing
toward the Indians, who were forming
in a procession by the chapel door. "As I
am short of hymnals, you and the Sergeant
will have to share one, Miss Durant. Hymn
674. 'Peace, Perfect Peace.'"</p>

<p>Evelyn stood still. "I absolutely decline
to be associated in any way whatever with
Sergeant Scarlett."</p>

<p>"Oh, my children!" remonstrated the minister.
"How can we talk of missionizing the
heathen when the Gentiles so wrangle
among themselves! Ready, please! Fall
into line!" Striking up the tune, he led the
way.</p>

<p>And, somehow, in despite of her protest,
Miss Durant found herself following, side
by side with the hated young soldier, sharing
the same hymnal, moreover, and joining
her sweet voice with his manly one in praise
of "Peace, Perfect Peace."</p>

<h2><a id="VIII"></a>VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">AT THE SIGN OF THE TEMPERANCE SALOON.</p>

<p>"One sandwich, pie an' corfee,
three-fifty! One ham an' eggs,
pie, corfee, five! One whiskey
on a doctor's prescription, two bits!" Thus
Gumboot Annie scored off their reckonings
to a party of prospectors who had patronized
her lunch-tent, whereupon the prospectors
meekly handed their pokes across the
counter for her to weigh out the dust, according
to her own liberal interpretation.</p>

<p>"Halt!" Barney's rich brogue rang out
upon the trail. "Twinty minutes for refrishmints
by request, for man and baste!"</p>

<p>"What's up now?" Gumboot Annie put
her head out to reconnoitre. "Why, who's
thet blamed cop runnin' in?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's pop!" in dismay, cried Gelly,
who was assisting the mother of Klondike
Delmonicos in the capacity of bean-slinger.
"My pop!" She began to cry.</p>

<p>"Aye, it's Bully Nick, all right," corroborated<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
a prospector, selecting a wooden
toothpick with nicety. "They're fixin' ter
extrydite him. Charge of murder. Oh, he'll
be hanged this time fer sure!" he added,
with relish.</p>

<p>"Now, wouldn't thet jostle yer!" exclaimed
Gumboot Annie, generally. "But
didn't the stiff he peppered get well some?"</p>

<p>"Yep, and they let off th' Bully on parole.
But ef th' all-fired fool didn't celebrate his
freedom by gittin' crazy drunk and shootin'
at a United States Deputy Marshal fer targit!
The marshal was a mean man an' deserved
ter die&mdash;but Nick should 'a' left it
to a meaner man to shoot him."</p>

<p>"A United States Marshal!" exclaimed
Gumboot Annie, scornfully. "Shucks!
Drunk or sober, I thought Nick had more
sense."</p>

<p>"Nick shoots blind when"&mdash;her informant
considerately lowered his voice&mdash;"when he's
on the rampage for Dandy Raish. Nick has
sworn ter kill Raish on sight along of
Gelly."</p>

<p>"Gumboot Annie! Gumboot Annie!"
Bill's eager voice rang out on the clear air,
as he came running toward the tent.</p>

<p>"We're planning for to give Bully Nick a
handsome send-off. Rustle, won't you? and
get us up an A1, gilt-edged blow-out!"<span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>"Betcherboots I will," promised Gumboot
Annie, cordially, adding that the Bully
would be a great loss, socially, if hanged.</p>

<p>"'Twas the drink done it&mdash;and I cud ha'
kept him from it," moaned Gelly, rocking
and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"Here, stop whining and make the sandwiches.
Better git down behind the stove
whar yer pop can't see yer!" Gumboot
Annie gave the girl an ungentle but not unkindly
push, and thrusting a carving-knife
into her hand, bade her, as it might be the
old man's last square feed upon this planet,
not to spare the butter.</p>

<p>"Gents, I thankee hearty for these here
evidences of popularity," cried the Bully, as
they placed him at the head of the well-filled
board inside the lunch-tent. "Gents,
go thou an' do likewise, but don't git
pinched! Ah, well, ef I'd got my deserts I
guess I'd'a' bin strung up twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"Better late than nivver," politely remarked
Barney, who, as an honored guest,
by his gift of repartee was contributing
greatly to the meal's hilarity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Mush, get up, there! Godam you, Teleglaph
and Langel. Mush!" Thus Chilkat
Jo might have been heard profanely to encourage
to increase of speed on a pious errand<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
the parson's dogs that now were drawing
a sled beside which the parson and the
trader were running on their snow-shoes
toward Gumboot Annie's tent. For all this
took place many miles from Perdu and Lost
Shoe Creek, on the heights where the snow
still lingered in heavy, frozen masses,
though the valleys below were abloom with
summer flowers. "Him velly damn sick,"
he pityingly added, indicating the bundle
wrapped in furs, strapped to the sled.</p>

<p>"Very sick, indeed, I fear, my son; but
not damn sick," the minister corrected.
"Perhaps we can get succor here. Whoa,
Telegraph, Wrangle, lads, whoa!" Halting
opposite the tent, he read its legend with
surprise, "TEMPERANCE SALOON. GUMBOOT
ANNIE, PROPRIETOR."</p>

<p>"Why, my daughter," he accosted the hostess,
who, hearing sleigh-bells and scenting
custom, had come forth, "does this indicate
a happy change of heart and saving grace?
You are taking thought to save your soul?"</p>

<p>"Save my skin," retorted the Gumbooted
one, spitting with an accurate estimate of
distances. "That blamed Scarlett was making
things hot for me, so I jest wheeled the
hull outfit acrost the boundary!" She
pointed to an old Russian landmark, protruding
like a tiny headstone from the snow,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
and followed by a line of rude pickets, the
records of a surveying party, that straggled,
single file, downhill, dividing the United
States from British North America. "Lasky's
a prohibition proposition, y'know."</p>

<p>"Whatever the motive, the action is most
praiseworthy," Maclane commended her,
"since your income must be greatly decreased
by foregoing the sale of intoxicants."</p>

<p>"Now wouldn't thet jar yer!" demanded
Gumboot Annie, humorously, of the landscape.
"I ain't up here fer me health," she
then reminded the minister. "Fines or license,
it's all one ter me. And prohibition,
or wide open, you betcherlife the boys has
jest the same old thirst."</p>

<p>"H'm! Well, for the present I will waive
the ethical aspect of the argument," replied
Maclane, "and will beg you to sell me some
stimulant for medicinal purposes. We have
a lad here whom we found in trouble by the
wayside; he is very low&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's it a case of?" Gumboot Annie
leaned across the counter to inspect the
bundle on the sled, from which Jo was now
unharnessing the dogs. "Drink or scurvy?"</p>

<p>"Neither," replied Maclane, raising the
patient's head; "but, I fear, foul play."</p>

<p>"Now don't that pa'alyze yer!"</p>

<p>From a bottle she took from its hiding-place,
Gumboot Annie poured out a generous
dose. "Here, Ikey, take that ter the
kid."</p>

<p>"Whiskey, two bits!" cried Ikey, from
sheer force of habit, as he obeyed.</p>

<p>"Stop thet, yer little skin!" Leaning far
over the counter, to the endangerment of
her balance, his employer gave him a smart
cuff. "I'm as close as they make 'em when
I'm dealing with the healthy, but I've yet
ter see myself take money from a dyin'
man."</p>

<p>"He told me to meet him here to-day,"
gasped Walter Pierce, as Maclane bent over
him with skilful ministry.</p>

<p>"Who, my son?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Wait&mdash;it is a secret! I have a
confession to make."</p>

<p>When Gumboot Annie and her assistant
had withdrawn, and the Indian had gone to
a distance to feed the dogs, Walter tried to
speak.</p>

<p>"It was the drink!"</p>

<p>"It generally is," commented the parson,
mournfully.</p>

<p>"I had an errand for another man&mdash;one of
the greatest importance. He trusted me.
Some men suspected his secret and dogged
my footsteps, entered into conversation with<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
me&mdash;pretended to take a fancy to me&mdash;to
show themselves my friends&mdash;good fellows.
They made me drink with them. Then I, in
my turn, stood treat to keep my end up and
show myself a good fellow."</p>

<p>"Alas!" whispered the minister, as Walter
paused for breath, "how many lads have I
seen go down to the lowest depths, under
that banner bearing the devil's own device:
To show one's self a good fellow!"</p>

<p>"Then, when they had got me where they
wanted me, drunk," continued the sick man,
"they robbed me. Oh, not of money&mdash;for
though they made me play, they let me win&mdash;but
of my honor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my son! It was you who threw
away your own honor."</p>

<p>"If only I had thought of that at the time!
Now they have his secret&mdash;his samples.
They'll know about his mine! Tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The minister worked over the fainting
form with tender skill. At last, when a
glimmer of consciousness returned, "Now,
my son," he said, "you owe it to the man
you have wronged to make restitution. Tell
me who he is, and what I am to say to him."</p>

<p>Walter gathered his strength for a supreme
effort. "Durant," at last he managed
to gasp. "Tell his daughter&mdash;&mdash;" He fell
back in the stupor that precedes death.<span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>"O Joseph! Chilkat Jo!" called Maclane.
And when the Indian, obeying with
alacrity, replied, "Godam you, what you
want?" he did not stay to reprove him, only
bade him, "Run hot-foot to Lost Shoe Creek
and fetch Miss Durant. Tell her I have a
message from her father!"</p>

<p>When the trader had set off, the speed of
his winged-footed race redoubled by good
will, Maclane, having drawn the sled to a
spot where a clump of evergreens would
act as wind-brake, went to the Customs
Office on the crest of the hill in search of
remedies.</p>

<p>Seeing the coast clear, old Blenksoe, who
for some time past had been hovering
about the place, now came to the lunch
counter, where he soon was joined by his
arch-accomplice in villainy, Dandy Raish.
"Hello, old tortoise!" was the hitter's salutation
as his partner sauntered up. "I've
been waiting for you this ever so long."</p>

<p>"Thet you hevn't," contradicted Blenksoe.
"Not that it matters&mdash;but you allus
were a fust-class liar!"</p>

<p>"Some folks have not enough imagination
to lie," retorted the Dandy, paring his nails.
"But chuck all that and get to business!"</p>

<p>"Business! Hully gee! Anythin' doin'?
Am I in it?"<span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;if you can deliver the goods! Order
the drinks, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Say, you got a tocter's brescription for
liquor?" queried Ikey, when old Blenksoe
did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>"I'll sure hev an undertaker's stiff-ticket
ef I don't get it," replied Blenksoe, as he
carried the medicinal doses over to the
bench where the Dandy had ensconced himself.</p>

<p>"Best stay out here where no one can
hear us," explained the latter.</p>

<p>"That suits me all right," agreed Blenksoe,
lighting a pipe and settling himself on
the Canadian side. "Thar's a warrant out
fer my arrest in 'Lasky."</p>

<p>"I thought you were <i>persona non grata</i>
in the Dominion also, since that hold-up of
the stage near Lost Shoe Creek."</p>

<p>"Thet hold-up you put me up to, while
you sneaked in the bushes. You'd orter be
pinched yerself fer takin' a rake-off. Ain't
the receiver as bad as the thief?"</p>

<p>"Piano, pianissimo," advised Raish. "One
never knows who's within earshot." He
glanced about him fearfully.</p>

<p>"Thet's so," admitted Blenksoe. "I declar,
what between Kennedy on the one
hand and Uncle Sam on t'other, and both
a-gittin' so all-fired pertikeler, every day<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
makes it harder for a crook ter make an
honest livin'." He lighted an ill-smelling
pipe. "Well, Dandy, fire away."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Durant lately?"</p>

<p>"Durant? Who th' hell's Durant?"</p>

<p>"Your partner, Lucky. Durant is his outside
name."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Oh, Lucky, he ain't no
good no more. Lucky's off his nut. Went
stark, ravin' mad the day his gal came inter
camp. I've shuk Lucky."</p>

<p>"More fool you. He's found a mine!"</p>

<p>"I dessay. As usual, a pocket, or a pot
of gold eagles at th' fut of a rainbow."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. A bona-fide mine. What
d'you make of these samples?"</p>

<p>Through his prospector's glass, Blenksoe
examined the small clods of earth Raish
held out to him, then uttered the profanest
expletive at his command.</p>

<p>"Free gold, assayin' sixty ter th' ton!"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe it is!" The Dandy
pocketed the samples which Blenksoe was
eyeing hungrily.</p>

<p>"Say, I'd like a sample ter test. Oh, well,
as you say! How'd you come by 'em?"</p>

<p>"I got them with the information from a
kid whom Lucky has taken in on the ground
floor."</p>

<p>"You mean ter tell me the stiff hes shuk<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
me, his pard an' dearest friend?" Blenksoe
seized his gun. "I'll fix Lucky!"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, you old fool! Durant don't
owe you a bean, and you know it. And the
way you've always grafted on him he is not
likely to run after you to put you wise."</p>

<p>"Thet's so. Whar is the mine?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's just where my information
stops short. If I knew I shouldn't need
you."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose the game is ter lay low,
rubber round till we locate the claim, and
jump it."</p>

<p>"And have that blasted Scarlett butting
in? Guess again! Claim-jumping don't go,
now the M. P. are in charge. We have to
do something far cleverer. I'll tell you
what. I've thought it all out. We have to
kidnap Durant, and kidnap his daughter."</p>

<p>"Why the hell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blenksoe, a cow could give you cards and
spades. We'll play them off, one against
the other, till he signs over a half interest
in his mine for ransom."</p>

<p>"Dandy, you're a wonder!" Blenksoe regarded
the brains of the concern with admiration.
"I'll get the gang on to it to
oncet. It ull be no trick at all ter kidnap
Lucky. Lucky's dead easy! But the gal&mdash;gals
is scarce, and conspickerous accordin',<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
in a mining camp. How the hell are we to
handle the gal?"</p>

<p>"Leave her to me. I have already struck
up a traveling acquaintance with her; managed
to do her some little service en route.
That's why I was careful to keep in the
background during the hold-up. I sent her
a private message to meet me here to-day,
telling her I had a confidential message
from her father. We must act like a flash,
for that blasted Scarlett is sweet on her.
By Jove! that's an idea!" The Dandy
slapped his knee. "I owe him a bad turn.
I'll cut him out! I'll marry her myself!"</p>

<p>"You, you son of a camp cook!" sneered
Blenksoe.</p>

<p>Raish shrugged his shapely shoulders.
"The camp cooks of to-day are the swells of
to-morrow. I'm ambitious. I've always qualified
myself for the toniest society. I spend
as much for perfumery as for liquor, and I
never sleep between sheets but I wear pink
silk pyjamas."</p>

<p>"By gum, I b'lieve you'll git thar!" cried
Blenksoe, overcome by these evidences of
culture. Going to the counter, before Raish
could stop him, he ordered: "Set up th'
drinks, Ikey! Here's ter Dandy an' his
bride!"</p>

<p>"Haow's that? Raish a-goin' ter git married?"<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
inquired Gumboot Annie, who was
bustling about for more provender for the
banqueters inside the tent. "And who's the
lady?"</p>

<p>"Oh, jest a little silk-stockin' proposition
from the States," replied old Blenksoe, unmindful
of the Dandy's warning signs. "One
of the Noo York smarties, and jes' fitted fer
Raish."</p>

<p>"Eh?" shrieked Gelly, starting up from
her corner behind the stove. "She is, is
she! And what about me?"</p>

<p>"Gelly! Tagging on as usual!" exclaimed
Raish, in disgust.</p>

<p>"Thar, thar, Gelly! I was only joshin',"
Blenksoe tried to soothe the girl.</p>

<p>"Dandy, you're a wonder!" Blenksoe re<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
him, pleading. "Pop is run in, and mebbe
goin' ter be hanged. Raish, make an honest
woman of me that I may go bid him good-by!"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Transcriber's Note: One or more lines are missing in the original.</p></div>

<p>The Dandy drew back. "What! Me, with
my prospects, take up with the daughter of
a murderer!"</p>

<p>"You, you&mdash;&mdash;" Gelly flew at him with
the carving-knife she held.</p>

<p>"Here, quit that!" Gumboot Annie
adroitly snatched away the weapon. "My
sandwich-knife! Now wouldn't thet stick
yer?" in aggrieved tones she appealed to an<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
imaginary audience on the horizon line.
Bystanders joined in the discussion, and,
attracted by the noise, some of the diners
came running from the tent, the Japanese
paper napkins, that the high character
of the occasion had warranted, in hand,
ready for a scrap or any other fun that
might be going; accordingly, the Dandy saw
the wisdom of adopting a conciliating policy.
"Gelly"&mdash;he led the girl aside&mdash;"I do
mean to do the square thing by you, but no
man likes to be coerced, you know; and after
what has gone between us I don't want to
be laughed at publicly for a fool&mdash;and if
you love me, you don't want to render me
publicly ridiculous. Just go back, quietly,
like a good girl and wait for me at Lost Shoe
Creek. When I have one or two tangles
straightened out I'll come back and marry
you, honest! But remember, on the quiet,
If you blab&mdash;well, I'll see you somewhere
before I ever speak to you again. Now,
good-by and go!"</p>

<p>And for the last time, though not the first,
poor Gelly trusted him.</p>

<p>Looking after the red-cloaked and hooded
figure, as on snow-shoes she sped lightly
down the trail, the Dandy laughed. "Women
are easy, dead easy!" he exclaimed; and
then he laughed still louder, as winding in<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
and out through mountain passes the sound
of approaching sleigh-bells and girls' merry
voices floated through the crystal air.
"Dead, dead easy," he reiterated, with the
unction of enjoyment in his sapient superiority.
"Here comes Evelyn now!"</p>

<h2><a id="IX"></a>IX.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE PROVISIONAL BOUNDARY.</p>

<p>"Miss Durant! This is a delightfull surprise!" Dismounting
from her sled drawn by
eight frisky little huskies, Miss Durant encountered
not the Mr. Horatio Travers who
had written, begging for a private interview
near Gumboot Annie's, on a confidential
mission from her father, but the handsome
and genial presence of Sergeant Scarlett.</p>

<p>"The surprise at least is not all on one
side," laughed Evelyn, giving him her hand.
"What are you doing so far from headquarters?"</p>

<p>"My jurisdiction extends to the boundary
line. Just now it is my painful duty to meet
a United States Representative in yonder
Customs building, and formally make over
to him the person of Bully Nick."</p>

<p>"Ah, the poor Bully!" Evelyn sighed. "He
has this incorrigible habit of shooting the
wrong people. But I'm in hopes of getting<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
him off. I shall spare no expense. I've
wired to Sitka, in my father's name, for the
ablest counsel to defend him."</p>

<p>"And, confidence for confidence," said
Scarlett, "what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just keeping an appointment&mdash;I
mean, mushing it with Sarah and the girls
for a day's outing," Evelyn hurriedly corrected
herself, recalling that Travers' note
enjoined the strictest secrecy. "And, pardon
me, I must go to their rescue now." To conceal
a slight embarrassment caused by her
prevarication, she sped toward her party on
whom the Customs' officials of two nations
had pounced down, assuming that they intended
to cross the boundary and must be
treated like malefactors accordingly.</p>

<p>Picking up the muff that Evelyn in her
haste had dropped, Scarlett buried his face
in the soft fur. "I'm another," he confided
to it.</p>

<p>"'Tis himself!" Barney hurried toward
him from the tent, but as Scarlett, in his abstraction,
did not notice him, he inquired,
with solicitude: "Are ye here, sorr?"</p>

<p>"Faith, no, man. I'm wandering."</p>

<p>"Is ut impty ye do be feeling yourself inside,
sorr?"</p>

<p>"Empty is it, with the appetite that's
there! Bring me rations out here. Bring a<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
double share." His eye strayed toward
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"H'm! 'Tis a case of wan plate and two
spoons, or I'm a blind man!" commented
Barney, hastening to obey.</p>

<p>"Miss," cried Sarah, in shocked accents,
as Evelyn drew near, "them orphans are
flirting outrageously with the Customs gentlemen
of both nations, and feeding them
with fudge."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," mocked Evelyn, "we must
put a stop to that at all costs, Sarah. Take
the girls into the tent and give them their
dinner&mdash;or there will be international complications."</p>

<p>"Internal ones, more likely," put in Scarlett,
who had followed her. "Sweet things
don't often come our way. And speaking of
sweet things, Miss Durant, won't you yourself
mess with me out here in the open?
Just for the experience, ye know. It isn't
really cold. The snow is left over from the
winter, but it's a summer sun overhead."</p>

<p>"It does look tempting," confessed Evelyn,
as Barney appeared, bringing with him
provender, with its equipments, for two,
deftly arranging it on a table by the bench.
"I'm early for my appointment&mdash;I mean, I
have plenty of time, and Sarah can chaperon
the girls."<span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>"Have ye room enough?" with solicitude
inquired the soldier, placing himself beside
her.</p>

<p>"Plenty, thanks. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Too much," he protested, "on the wrong
side." The bench having no back, he gallantly
supplied the lack. "Allow me to
make ye an arm-chair."</p>

<p>Evelyn properly edged away. "Sergeant,
are these your company manners?"</p>

<p>"Surely, since two's company."</p>

<p>"Come, come, I can't permit you so much
latitude!"</p>

<p>"If you knew your map ye'd know that
the further north ye go the closer the lines
of latitude are drawn."</p>

<p>"Speaking of maps, I wish you'd tell me
exactly where we are?"</p>

<p>"Faith, where I am is exactly what I'm
trying to find out&mdash;how far I've gone with
you."</p>

<p>"Do be sensible, if you can, and tell me
where we are sitting, geographically speaking."</p>

<p>"Geographically speaking, we are sitting
on the provisional boundary between our
respective nations."</p>

<p>"Oh! Please don't add it is called provisional
because one stops here for provisions."<span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>"At any rate, provisions don't stop here
long. Here, I've saved ye the last bean."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I take my bean wherever I
find it."</p>

<p>"Good! Now will ye poach on my preserves?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure!" Evelyn held out her
tin plate. "I love peaches."</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm more exclusive. I only love a
peach!"</p>

<p>"One at a time, no doubt, you mean. And
for the sake of your taste, I hope, fresh ones,
not canned. By the way, you, I believe,
would write them tinned?"</p>

<p>"But we both pronounce them excellent."
Scarlett divided with her the last spoonful
of the fruit.</p>

<p>"A century ago you taxed my tea." Leaning
over, Evelyn took the extra lump of
sugar from the young man's saucer. "So
now, to even things, I steal your sugar."</p>

<p>"Quite right," he acquiesced, "since revenge
is sweet."</p>

<p>"How silly this climate makes one,
though I wish all international differences
could be so bloodlessly adjusted," remarked
Evelyn. "Suppose, instead of war,
we had spelling matches! That, indeed,
would bring peace with honor."</p>

<p>"Sure and there'd be fighting over peace,"<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
the soldier told her, "since you would spell
it H-O-N-O-R, while I should insert a U."</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied Evelyn. "Your nation's
honor always will include U."</p>

<p>"A pretty compliment," conceded Scarlett,
"but I feel as if I had been spelling for
it." As they had finished he put aside the
dinner-tray. "I wonder if I shall ever persuade
you to cross the line in earnest?"</p>

<p>"And pray, why should I do the crossing?
Why should not you be the one to come over
to the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm a soldier! And I could not love
thee, dear, so much, loved I not HONOUR
more!"</p>

<p>"All very fine, sir, but, like England,
somehow you have advanced imperceptibly
across the boundary."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Scarlett moved closer to her.
"Like England, when I make advances I
push the line ahead of me."</p>

<p>"Remember the old commination," Evelyn
exhorted him, "'Cursed be he that moveth
his neighbor's landmark.'"</p>

<p>"That was ancient law," Scarlett reminded
her. "The modern dispensation bids
thee love thy neighbor as thyself. And up
here, where both nations work side by side,
common hardship makes us truly neighbors,
next of kin. Look yonder!" He pointed to<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
the summit of the watershed, the ridge-pole
of the mountain range, where, sheltered under
one roof, were the Customs offices of two
nations, while from lofty flag-poles floated,
side by side, the Union Jack and the Stars
and Stripes. "The snow, as it melts, parts
into two rivers, one running down into the
Dominion, the other into the States, each
bearing greetings from the sister flags. And,
listen! In the tent, to the same tune the
two national anthems are being sung&mdash;&mdash;"
Rising, he bared his head, Evelyn standing
beside him, while in perfect attune the banqueters
sang, according to their allegiance:
"My Country, 'Tis of Thee," or "God Save
the King."</p>

<p>"After all," commented Scarlett, "peace
is spelled without a difference, both sides
of the boundary; and, lip to lip, our views
will be identical on the way of spelling
love."</p>

<p>"And how may that be?" inquired Evelyn,
gathering up her furs and moving away.
"In love-letters?" As Scarlett caught up
with her she quickened her pace, remarking,
"I must go now. Really, Sergeant, you
ought some day to give us a lecture on these
theories of yours, for I have always wondered
how an Irishman makes love."</p>

<p>"Like a lover, sure," promptly retorted<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Scarlett, catching her in his arms and stooping
his head to hers.</p>

<p>To her surprise, Evelyn found herself
more than half consenting to his kiss even
while trying to rebuke it. Before, however,
she had found breath to protest, Scarlett released
her hurriedly in silence, for at the
moment Nick, with his custodian, and followed
by his faithful henchmen, came from
the tent, escorting Sarah and the orphans in
an aura of national and personal good will,
while a messenger came to inform the Sergeant
that the United States representative,
to whom the prisoner's person was to be delivered,
had arrived.</p>

<p>Evelyn, for her part, overcome with an
embarrassment mingled with another feeling
that was wholly new to her, ran in the
opposite direction down the trail, and over
a patch of frozen snow to a secluded spot
sheltered by a thicket of scrub firs, where,
even as she broke from her lover's embrace,
she had seen her former traveling acquaintance
and present correspondent, Horatio
Travers, awaiting her.</p>

<p>Scarlett went up immediately to the Customs
building, there to transact the formalities
incident to the extradition of Bully
Nick. These concluded, and the official
courtesies having been duly proffered and<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
accepted, he at last felt free to continue his
interrupted wooing. Coming out into the
open, he was going to seek Evelyn in a
merry group where the orphans were being
taught the art of keeping erect on snow-shoes,
when he was accosted by Maclane.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sergeant! I am called upon to
marry a couple under circumstances of a
peculiar nature, involving exceptional haste.
There is no Gold Commissioner, I find, nor
Justice of the Peace, in the district, nor
within a day's journey, from whom to obtain
a license; but I have consented to accept
a copy of the Dominion Marriage Act,
or rather a specified clause thereof, signed
by yourself as Mounted Policeman in
charge. Will that arrangement satisfy you,
judicially speaking?"</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Scarlett, "any marriage
that you can, with conscience, solemnize I
can sanction without a conscience, sir."</p>

<p>"I never was called upon to perform a
duty that I liked so ill," the minister acknowledged,
as he followed the soldier to
the Customs building. "In fact, I have exceeded
my prerogative, through my personal
interest in one of the contracting parties,
in counseling, beseeching, delay. Yet
what can I do? The young lady is of age;
she is determined on the step; moreover, she<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
has her father's consent, while I have not
one single argument to urge against it,
merely a feeling of dislike, distrust, for the
gentleman of her choice."</p>

<p>"In primitive regions I have found it unwise
to oppose too many obstacles to marriages,"
remarked the soldier, who, by this
time, was busily copying the required clause
from a sheepskin-covered tome, "since there
is always a popular tendency to forego the
ceremony, if it involves the slightest
trouble. Oh, I'm used to this! Also, I have
had not a few applications for divorces."</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed the minister. "Surely
you do not grant them, my young friend?"</p>

<p>"I have no power to," Scarlett told him.
"The best I can do under such circumstances
is to give the applicants a bill of Dissolution
of Partnership, to minimize the squabbling
over the division of the outfit. These present
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of yours may be my next candidates.
There." He handed Maclane the
paper. "Now it is ready for the signatures&mdash;yours
and mine. But, first, these
blanks must be filled in with the names of
bride and groom."</p>

<p>"They shall write them for themselves,"
replied the minister, who was visibly agitated.
"Not by a pen stroke will I further
them beyond what is forced upon me." Going<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
to the door he beckoned two persons
waiting without, and to Scarlett's amazement
summoned by name, "Horatio Travers!
Evelyn Durant!"</p>

<p class="h3">LUCKY'S LUCK.</p>

<p>Cheerful, erect, recreated in body
and spirit, Durant came to Gumboot
Annie's hostelry, where he had
made an appointment to meet Walter
Pierce. Not seeing the young man, and having
his own reasons for not letting it be
known that there was anything of a business
nature between them, he refrained
from making inquiries; ordered a cup of coffee,
and, lighting a pipe, seated himself in
a sheltered nook outside the tent to wait.</p>

<p>He had not been there long when the altercation
between Dandy Raish and Gelly
interrupted the banquet then in progress,
bringing the diners from the tent, Nick,
closely guarded by Barney, in the van.</p>

<p>Gelly, acting on Raish's instructions, had
gone speeding down the trail, but the Dandy
still lingered, to keep his secret tryst with
Evelyn.</p>

<p>Catching sight of him, the Bully, handcuffed<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
as he was, made a furious lunge at
him. "Thet thar's the snake I've swore ter
kill!" he shouted. "Let me free!"</p>

<p>"No, sorr!" Barney restrained him. "No
cheatin' av the extry-edition, if ye please."</p>

<p>Every one began to talk at once, his followers
urging the Bully to vengeance or forgiveness,
according to their natural dispositions,
at present heightened by conviviality,
while Raish, fearing lest the former policy
should prevail, held up a hand for truce.
"It's all right, Nick. You don't understand.
Stand back, you fellows, can't you, and
give me a word alone with Nick."</p>

<p>"Aye!" acquiesced the Bully. "I don't
need help to curse ye, Raish. When I'm
through with him, lads, I'll leave him to you
ter skin him fer the skunk he is, d'ye see?"</p>

<p>"Can't you leave us?" inquired Raish of
Barney, who still stood his ground by Nick.</p>

<p>"No, sorr, I cannot."</p>

<p>"But it's a private matter."</p>

<p>"Bedad, thin, that takes me in all right,
since I'm a private meself till promoted."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! Only I didn't like to drag
in a woman's name before a third person,"
explained the Dandy. "What I want to say,
Nick, is this: I'm awfully sorry for all the
trouble I've brought on you. It's not entirely
my fault, the way women do pursue<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
a fellow. But never mind all that," he hastened
to add as the Bully began to growl
ominously. "I want you to know that I intend
to do the square thing. I'm going to
marry Gelly."</p>

<p>"Eh?" cried Nick, unable to believe his
ears. "You'll right my gal! Honest, Raish?"</p>

<p>"On my honor as a gentleman&mdash;that is, if
she'll have me. Now, don't get angry, Nick,
till I explain. Something has turned her
against me of late. Suppose you write her
a little note, advising her to do it."</p>

<p>"Advisin' her! I'll skin her if she kicks!"
threatened Nick. "Here, boy," he turned to
Barney, "get me quit of these bracelets
while I write ter my darter."</p>

<p>"No, sorr, I wull not!"</p>

<p>"I tell ye it's my last words&mdash;good-by&mdash;to
my darter."</p>

<p>"First or last, sure ye can dictate your
autography."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang!" ejaculated the Bully.</p>

<p>"Sure, thin, that's for what I'm saving
ye!"</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no word profane enough ter
describe ye, d'ye see?" Nick told his keeper.
"Here, boys, which one of ye kin write?"
he called over to his followers.</p>

<p>"Don't make her name common with that
gang," cautioned the Dandy, whose alert<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
mind was actively evolving a new piece of
villainy as the situation developed. "Ask
an older man; a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You've never done a thing ter her name,
hev yer?" inquired the Bully, wrathfully,
yet not wholly rejecting the advice. "Here,
Sandy, man, come write a message for me.
You've had schoolin'."</p>

<p>"Ou, aye!" assented the Scotchman,
"ower muckle schoolin'. Mon, mon, when I
reflect on a' this sma' head contains! I'll
e'en gie ye a selection fra' Marmion&mdash;or a
wee bit o' Rabbit Burruns." Being, however,
far gone in conviviality, he maundered
off into protestations of undying affection
for his leader, assuring him he'd e'en gie his
proper copposeetion to see him hangit decently.</p>

<p>Disgusted, Nick shoved Sandy aside, and
in so doing caught a glimpse of Durant in
his corner, smoking peaceably. "Thar's old
man Lucky!" he exclaimed, even as Raish
had foreseen. "Might ask him ter help us
out. Hi, Lucky! Want ter do me a good
turn?"</p>

<p>"Willingly." Rising, Durant joined him.
"What is it, Nick?"</p>

<p>"Waal, the government thinks so much
of me these days I hev to employ a secretary
fer me correspondence, d'ye see? Say, will<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
you write down a message fer me to my
gal?"</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in the world," assented
Durant, heartily.</p>

<p>"Babper an' envelobe, two bits. Ben an'
ink, two bits. Plotter, two bits, bostache-shtamp,
two bits!" At Nick's order, Ikey
set writing materials before them on the
counter.</p>

<p>"Say, Nick," Raish prompted, in an undertone,
while Durant was removing his
snow-spectacles and chafing his stiff fingers,
"best not enter into details. Best let bygones
be bygones. Best just say you want
your daughter to let me bring her as my
wife to pay you a visit during your enforced
captivity&mdash;perhaps to say good-by."</p>

<p>"You let me choose my own words, and
be damned to yer."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! Only I don't see why you
should be in a hurry to shame me and Gelly
before an outsider."</p>

<p>"My gal has shamed herself, and thar
ain't no shamin' you!" Nick, however, acted
on the advice. "Ready, Lucky? Say, I
don't know how to start it. I kin jaw her
fluent ter her face, but I never wrote her
afore." He hesitated, embarrassed.</p>

<p>Smiling reassuringly, Durant pointed to
the words he already had mechanically set<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
down. "My dear daughter&mdash;that's how I
begin to my own girl."</p>

<p>"Darter don't look as if it was spelled
right," criticized the Bully. "But you know
best, Lucky. Fire away! Make it affectionate,
but firm, d'ye see? Tell her I'll cuss
her in this life and skin her in the next ef
she don't let Raish bring her ter me as his
wife ter say good-by. No trimmin's, mind!
Blow the signiture! She'll know fast
enough it comes from me."</p>

<p>"Your loving dad," Durant concluded.
"That's how I end off when I'm writing to
Evelyn."</p>

<p>"Pop ud 'a' sounded more nateral," remarked
the Bully. "But mebbe dad is dockimentary.
So let her go."</p>

<p>"Add a postscript," in a hurried whisper
Raish enjoined Durant. "Tell her this is
just a matter of form, and that I promise on
my honor not to hold her to the arrangement
permanently, if it is distasteful to her.
Tell her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Durant looked up, surprised. "Surely all
that lies wholly between you and the young
woman."</p>

<p>"True," admitted Raish, "but as I don't
mind confiding in you that the young
woman is tired of me, I want her to feel secure
that in satisfying her father's scruples<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
I don't intend to take an unfair advantage
of her. Suppose I set that down myself." He
did so, writing rapidly, but clearly. "Now,
Mr. Durant," he handed the other the pen,
"you will add to your kindness to me more
than you dream by placing your signature
as witness to my pledge."</p>

<p>Durant did as he was asked, feeling that,
little as he understood the matter, he was
probably serving the best interests of the
unfortunate Gelly.</p>

<p>"As witness only," he, however, stated.
"It is an arrangement in which I take no
moral responsibility."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I understand your scruples and
respect them. The responsibility is mine
entirely. Just at present I cannot explain,
but later the whole position will be made
clear."</p>

<p>"What's all them goin's-on?" suddenly demanded
Nick, whose attention had been
momentarily distracted by an argument between
Mops and Sandy on the poetic merits
of Rabbit Burruns. "No monkeyin' with
dockiments over thar."</p>

<p>"I'm only directing it," explained the
Dandy, who had folded the letter and inclosed
it in an envelope.</p>

<p>Nick looked over his shoulder, breathing
heavily with interest. "By gum," he ejacu<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>lated,
wrathfully, "ef ye hevn't blotted my
gal's name, Raish, and not fer the fust
time!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="il_154"></a>
<img class="border2" src="images/il_154.jpg" width="256" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;DARTER DON&#39;T LOOK AS IF IT WAS SPELLED RIGHT,&quot; CRITICIZED BULLY.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make that all right!" The Dandy
put the letter in his breast and walked
away.</p>

<p>"Ef yer don't may yer sizzle!" Nick called
after him. Turning to Durant: "Pard, I'm
grateful," he declared, with feeling. "Pard,
the best wish I kin give ye is, may ye never
need no one ter do the same by you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nick. That's all right." Durant
looked about him, and seeing that
Raish was out of earshot and Blenksoe not
in sight, went closer to the Bully and his followers.
"Friends, there's something I want
to say to you," he began. "It's just this:
You've all done me a kindness to my dying
day I shan't forget. A fortnight ago, when
my girl came into camp expecting to find
me living in a diamond-encrusted palace,
and I stood there so forlorn she didn't
recognize me, a broken-hearted beggar, you
who by one word might have pricked the
bubble and humiliated me before her and
her before the world, by your silence protected
her and me. It was the noblest
thing&mdash;&mdash;" His voice broke; he wiped his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Thet's all right, Lucky! Brace up, old<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
man!" came from one and another of the
group.</p>

<p>"Aye, but now I want you all to hear my
good news!" cried Durant, detaining them
as they were preparing to go back into the
dining-tent to resume their interrupted
feast. "<i>It has all come true!</i> With so many
grafters and claim-jumpers round I daren't
be explicit, but I want you to know that my
luck has turned for good and all. Oh, this
time it's no pocket; it's the big strike of
which I've always dreamed. I don't deserve
it, some may think, after playing with
my girl's credulity, yet for her sake I thank
God with all my heart that I've won out!
Till it's staked and recorded I know you'll
all keep my secret&mdash;but, boys, every one of
you is in it, the Rainbow Mine!"</p>

<p>The same wonderful delicacy that had
marked their treatment of Evelyn did not
fail her father. The Bully and his gang
listened to this speech in respectful silence,
at its conclusion crying, "Great! Good for
you, old man! You done grand! Allus
knew you'd git thar fer keeps! Sure! Betcherlife!
That's what!" with every evidence
of conviction and spontaneous joy. But as
he walked off, Durant laughed. He did not
need to look back to know that fingers were
being pointed after him, winks interchanged<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
and foreheads tapped significantly, with
comment that found food for mirth, even
while it deplored: "Off his nut fer fair.
Balmy on the crumpet. Bats in his belfry.
Qualifying for Queer Street. Plumb crazy.
Poor old Lucky!"</p>

<p>Well, let them think so, bless them, since
another day would set them right and prove
him all he claimed to be. And then nothing
gold could procure would be too good for
them, nothing&mdash;this rough crew, more beast
than man, that had yet behaved like more
than man to his deceived, defenceless girl.</p>

<p>That hour&mdash;its memory was seared upon
his very soul&mdash;the hour of Evelyn's arrival
in camp that had witnessed the deepest
degradation, followed immediately by the
crowning justification and triumph of his
career. He visualized it now, as he walked:
In the Klondike Delmonico's, in her r&ocirc;le of
Lady Bountiful, Evelyn was dispensing hospitality
right and left. He alone, her father,
dared not enter in. Crushed, crazed, he
walked back to the spot where he had left
young Pierce. Him he found still brooding
beneath the huge pine, dazed, amid the ruin
of his own air castles. Then for one bad
moment Durant went really mad. Picking
up the gun he had dropped when an irresistible
force drew him to go watch the incoming<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
stage, he turned its deadly charge
against his fevered brain.</p>

<p>With a cry, Walter sprang forward, but
not before old Blenksoe, who had been
watching his associate's actions curiously,
seized him, capturing the gun. "No yer
don't, blast yer!"</p>

<p>"Give it to me, Blenksoe! Of what use is
my life to you?"</p>

<p>"Lucky you've been afore, and lucky you
may be yet, and when the luck turns I'm in
it, see?"</p>

<p>"Give it to me!" With a madman's fury,
Durant leaped at the other's throat, only to
be met by a blow that sent him reeling to
the ground with such force that a young
willow bush he clutched at was partially
uprooted. For a few seconds he lay prone,
foaming at the mouth and clawing the soil
with frenzied impotency. Then of a sudden
he paused, raised himself, face still downturned,
and burst into insane laughter that
made Pierce's blood run cold.</p>

<p>"Mad! Stark, starin' mad!" Blenksoe
turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"There's a squirrel on yonder tree I could
bring down for the dogs' supper if you'd
give me back my gun, Blenksoe," his laughter
spent, Durant meekly suggested as he
scrambled to a sitting posture.<span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>"Fetch her with a stun," was the succinct
reply, as, retaining his partner's weapon,
Blenksoe re-entered the tent.</p>

<p>Acting on the suggestion, Durant gathered
up a handful of clots, selecting them
carefully, and with deliberate aim took long
shots at the chattering creature on the
bough.</p>

<p>"Sit here, beside me, close, Walter," in
an undertone he bade the young clerk, who
still was gazing at him in horrified bewilderment.
"But don't start or show the
slightest surprise at what I am going to say.
Oh, tut, tut, lad, never fear!" For Pierce
seemed disinclined to comply with his command.
"I am not mad. That is all over,
thank God! with all the struggle, the heartbreak.
<i>The luck has turned</i>, do you hear?
Yes, turned for good and all! Every clot
that I am throwing contains gold!&mdash;careful!"
For involuntarily Walter had given
vent to an ejaculation of amazed incredulity.
"Oh, I'm an old prospector, and I see
indications, and read signs where these
grafters pass them by. I've always believed
in this locality, and now I'm justified. In
uprooting that willow I unearthed a bonanza!"
Pausing in his speech, he renewed his
attempts on the squirrel's life, and then
went on: "Yes, each dull handful of earth<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
I throw is a priceless witness that beneath
us, on this spot, lies the Rainbow Mine&mdash;&mdash;"
Breaking off, as he observed old Blenksoe
watching him narrowly, he rose as if discouraged,
with a sigh. "My hand shakes.
I'm no match to-day even for a squirrel.
I'll have to give it up." Then, cleverly
simulating the foolishly detailed actions of
one who, having lost his grasp on the great
things of life, clutches at the trivialities, he
set about replanting the willow, stamping
down the disordered earth about its roots,
meanwhile in a pregnant undertone continuing
his conversation with Walter.</p>

<p>The latter, so between them it was arranged,
was to hang about the locality,
watching for a chance, unobserved, to pick
up the valuable clots, and these he was to
have exchanged for their cash value, for
current expenses, at a bank so distant that
their source could not be predicated with
any degree of accuracy&mdash;a precaution that
Durant deemed essential in a district where
even officialdom was likely to be corrupted
by the lust for gold. He himself, meanwhile,
would watch his opportunity, and disappear,
without leaving a trace, from Lost
Shoe Creek, as if madness had indeed possessed
him, in order to throw Blenksoe off
the scent and cause him also to move on,<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
since, as Durant rightly conjectured, the
pastmaster of graft would not be likely
to remain in any spot which he thought
Lucky had turned down. To-day Walter
was to meet him here, return with him to
the scene of his discovery, aid him in staking
it, by stealth; journey to the nearest
office where recording-books were opened,
to file the claim with the necessary fee,
while Durant himself would remain, defending
the stakes, if need be, with his life.
Once his rights legally safeguarded, all the
world might know. Again Durant laughed
in joyful anticipation of his meeting with
Evelyn, when confession and revelation
would come in the same breath. Then, impatiently,
he looked up and down the trail,
wondering at Pierce's delay on this day of
days, when he heard a low moan among the
bushes, and, turning, beheld the young man
on whose co-operation such high hopes depended,
lying, bedded in furs, upon a sled,
swathed in bandages, pallid&mdash;a dying man.</p>

<p>"My God! Walter, my poor lad, what
does this mean?" exclaimed Durant, in
horrified accents.</p>

<p>Another moan was the only answer, but
reading in the glazing eyes a wish to speak,
Durant knelt down and bent so that his ear
touched the stiff lips.<span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>"What is it, Walter?"</p>

<p>"The samples," the young man at last
managed to articulate. "The mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, the mine&mdash;the samples!" cried Durant,
with frantic eagerness. But Walter's
confession never reached the man he had
betrayed. A sudden darkness came over
Durant. He struggled, but his grasp was
pinioned from behind. He tried to cry
aloud, but his voice was muffled. Swift,
treacherous hands seized him, gagged him,
bound him fast, bore him off, blind, mute, a
prisoner!</p>

<h2><a id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<p class="h3">AN INTERNATIONAL EPISODE</p>

<p>With an effort regaining the composure
unwontedly ruffled by
Scarlett's audacious response to
her challenge as to an Irishman's method of
love-making, while adjusting hat and hair,
whose order, as she blushingly was conscious,
had suffered from the same cause,
Evelyn hurried toward the fir-encircled spot
where she saw Dandy Raish awaiting her.</p>

<p>A fellow-passenger aboard the boat that
had brought her party up the Alaskan coast,
Travers had lost no chance to ingratiate
himself with Evelyn by rendering her all
manner of unobtrusive service, so that his
letter, requesting this appointment, at an
out-of-the-way place under conditions of absolute
secrecy, while exciting her curiosity,
caused her no alarm. The matter to which
he had mysteriously alluded, as of supreme
importance to herself and her father, she
had assumed to refer to Durant's vast mining<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
interests. She took it for granted that
the obliging Mr. Travers was bearer of a remittance
that would enable her to defy
Scarlett's absurd advice in favor of roughing
it, and enable her to resume her wonted
style of luxurious living.</p>

<p>To escape awkward questions, she had decided
to turn the expedition into a day's
outing that should include Sarah and her
young companions, thus giving her meeting
with Travers the appearance of chance.
Scarlett's unforeseen presence on the scene
only added a piquancy to the occasion, in
her eyes, since she thought it might furnish
her with an opportunity to put down that
estimable but altogether too masterful
young man. That the opportunity would
land her in the young man's arms was something
she had not reckoned with.</p>

<p>As Travers watched her speeding toward
him with glowing cheeks and eyes, a lovely
picture of blossoming young womanhood between
the wintry ground and summer sky,
something leaped to life in the Dandy's
breast that made it a hard task for him to
greet her with the grave impersonal politeness
it was his policy to assume, and determined
him more than ever to cut out
"that blasted Scarlett."</p>

<p>After formal salutations had been exchanged,<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
he remarked: "I think I saw you
speaking with some one in uniform, Miss
Durant. I trust it was not a member of the
Mounted Police?"</p>

<p>"It was Sergeant Scarlett."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Scarlett, of all men!
May I hope you did not mention our appointment
to him?"</p>

<p>"My appointments are my own affair, Mr.
Travers. Please let us get to the matter in
hand without delay. What is it you have to
say to me?"</p>

<p>"I am more anxious than you possibly can
be for haste, since to you the matter is but
one of temporary inconvenience, while to
carry it through I am risking my very life.
But before we go any further I must have
your sacred promise that what I say is in
inviolable confidence."</p>

<p>"Confidences between you and me, Mr.
Travers! Aren't you making too much of
what is probably some ordinary business
matter; taking rather an undue advantage
of my complaisance in granting you this interview?"</p>

<p>"Miss Durant, you wrong me. I tell you
that in seeking you I have nothing to gain,
everything to lose; life, honor, everything!
I am running this tremendous risk&mdash;not, as
you think, because you are a woman, young,<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
rich, beautiful; but because I owe a debt of
gratitude, that only life could pay, to your
dear father."</p>

<p>"My dear father! You come from him?
Then he knows of my arrival! Why isn't
he here himself to welcome me?" Evelyn's
questions came rushing eagerly.</p>

<p>"Miss Durant, he cannot come. He is a
prisoner."</p>

<p>"A prisoner! What do you mean?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>"A captive, rather; held by a gang of desperados
for ransom."</p>

<p>"God in heaven!" Evelyn went white.
"My daddy!"</p>

<p>"You are faint!" Raish went to her side,
supporting her.</p>

<p>"No, no! Thanks, I am all right." Evelyn
drew away. "But your pledge of secrecy&mdash;why,
it is preposterous! Every one should
be told. The alarm given&mdash;rewards offered&mdash;the
country roused!" She moved forward
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"No, no! Not as you value his life!"
Raish held her back. "Listen. One incautious
word, and your father is a dead man.
There are spies about us&mdash;everywhere. That
is why I got you to meet me here&mdash;Miss Durant,
believe me, by raising the hue and cry
you will sound your father's death-knell."<span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>Evelyn shuddered. "I can't believe&mdash;&mdash;"
she began, however, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I will explain. Miss Durant, you have
been in the district over two weeks&mdash;the district
in which you know your father's interests
to lie. Yet have you been able to locate
him, to obtain one satisfactory answer
as to his goings and comings, his present
whereabouts? Have you not invariably
been put off with specious generalities&mdash;sugar-plums
to soothe a wayward child?
Admit that no man has said to you in definite
terms, 'Yonder, on such and such a hill,
is the camp of Matthew Durant. By such
and such a trail can you reach him.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," admitted Evelyn.
"Every one puts me off. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The reason is," Raish interrupted her,
"that no one knows where, among those
mountains, his prison lies. But that he is
a prisoner is public property, though not a
soul has had the heart to break it to you."</p>

<p>"How cruel to have deceived me!" Evelyn
burst into a flood of tears. "And all the
time he is wondering why I don't rescue
him. But with his resources what is the
difficulty? Why has not he himself bought
his freedom?"</p>

<p>"Because their price is high&mdash;it is your
entire fortune&mdash;the Rainbow Mine&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
your father loves you too well to subject
you to poverty."</p>

<p>"It is like my father to put me first,"
sobbed Evelyn, "but doesn't he know me
better? Does he for a moment think I
would weigh any consideration on this
earth against his safety?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Raish, triumphantly, "I
knew you were true blue. That is what I
told my old friend Durant&mdash;but captivity
has so preyed on his spirits that he is ill&mdash;unable
to judge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My father ill!" Evelyn clenched her
little hands and moaned: "Oh, oh, oh! If
only I could go to him!"</p>

<p>"Have you the courage?" questioned
Raish.</p>

<p>"The courage!" She looked at him,
amazed. "If you know how to reach him take
me to him instantly!"</p>

<p>Raish almost laughed aloud. "Women are
dead easy," he mentally reiterated, before
replying: "Very good." He drew Evelyn's
furs closer about her neck, protectingly.
"I take you at your word. But we
must invent some excuse for our going off
together. We must elude pursuit. Above all,
we must get rid of your friend, the Irishman."</p>

<p>"I trust Sergeant Scarlett," said Evelyn.<span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>"And so do I!" cried Raish, with assumed
cordiality. "I trust that excellent young
man to do his duty and win promotion at all
costs. The Sergeant makes love like an
Irishman, Miss Durant. Ah, I saw!" he
checked her protest. "But believe me, not
even for your bright eyes will he sacrifice
his loyalty to the government he serves by
countenancing a dicker with the thieves, its
enemies."</p>

<p>"Let us leave the Sergeant out of the discussion,"
cried Evelyn, with blazing cheeks.
"What do you propose?&mdash;for by your manner
I see you have some plan."</p>

<p>"The plan is not mine. I never should
have ventured to suggest it," answered
Raish. "It is your father's, entirely. He
and I were taken prisoners together. I, as
the unimportant man, financially, am used
as intermediary, being sent here, on parole,
to treat with you for his release. Spies are
dogging my footsteps. Meanwhile, his life
is hostage, until I return with you in my
charge. Your father, ever scrupulous, fearing
compromising comment, were you to
travel with me alone, day and night, as we
shall have to do, advised&mdash;&mdash;" He paused,
as if delicacy made the words difficult.
"Miss Durant, he wishes you to go through
a form of marriage with me first."<span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>"I marry you!" gasped Evelyn.</p>

<p>"As a matter of form only; to be dissolved
when your father's freedom is secured."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never! It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Very good. I will carry back that answer."
Raish turned to go. "You send your
love to him, I suppose, Miss Durant, and as
he is a very sick man, good-by?"</p>

<p>"Stop," she commanded him. "Give me a
few moments. You are <i>sure</i> my father said
that&mdash;about a marriage ceremony?"</p>

<p>"Aye, furthermore, he wrote it," Raish assured
her. "Though to clear myself from
any suspicion of interested motives I begged
him to send the letter by another messenger.
You should already have received it
from the hand of Walter Pierce."</p>

<p>"Miss Durant! Where is Miss Durant?
Oh, Miss Durant!" At the moment Maclane's
agitated voice came toward them. As
Evelyn, responding, emerged from the
thicket he met her, breathlessly. Chilkat
Jo, whom he had despatched to Lost Shoe
Creek for Evelyn, had returned some time
before to announce that he had met her by
the way, but the minister, not expecting her
for hours, had to be hunted up among the
cabins further on, whither he had gone on
some errand of mercy. "I only just heard
of your arrival. How providential that you<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
should have chosen this of all days for your
expedition! A poor lad&mdash;Chilkat Joseph
and I found him by the wayside&mdash;the victim,
I fear, of foul play, has brought you
tidings of your father." As he spoke he was
hurrying her toward the spot where young
Pierce lay.</p>

<p>"Walter Pierce&mdash;my father!" Evelyn almost
shrieked in her excitement, but at a
warning sign from Travers, who had followed
her, controlled herself. "I have been
expecting him."</p>

<p>"After all I fear it is too late." Maclane
touched pulse and brow. "He is beyond
human help. He will not speak again."
Kneeling by the sled he began prayers for
the passing soul, when he was interrupted
by a cry from Evelyn, as Walter's arm,
which had rested loosely across his breast,
fell stiffly by his side, disclosing an open letter
which, as she saw immediately, was in
her father's hand.</p>

<p>"Women are dead easy&mdash;women and parsons,"
chuckled Raish, who had adroitly
placed the missive where Evelyn found it.
Going to her where she stood, apart, reading
her father's transcription of Nick's behest
to Gelly, "Well," he asked, "now are you
convinced?"</p>

<p>"One moment, please!" Without explanation<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
to him, Evelyn ran up the hill where,
international formalities complied with, under
the two flags the Bully was bidding his
followers farewell.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Nick"&mdash;she clasped his handcuffed
fists in her soft, warm palms&mdash;"you
welcomed me to the district; you are my oldest
friend. Tell me, when did you last see
my father?"</p>

<p>"Lucky? Why, now come ter think of it,
Lucky were here not an hour since. Fit as a
fiddle, now warn't he, boys? Grand reports
of the Rainbow Mine. Shovelin' out pay-dirt
like greased lightnin'! Ain't thet so,
boys? Sent love, of course, and he'd be in
ter see yer ter-morrer. His own words, d'ye
see? Eh, boys?"</p>

<p>To which the boys, challenged by Nick's
fiery eye, loyally responded: "Sure! Thet's
what! Betcherlife!"</p>

<p>Evelyn looked from face to face and read
that, beneath a clumsy mask, through heroic
but mistaken kindness, ill news was being
held back from her. "Thank you all so
much," she replied, and, turning, ran downhill
to rejoin Raish.</p>

<p>Sarah intercepted her. "Miss, I think we
had ought to be getting back to camp. The
orphans are behaving scandalous, getting
themselves engaged three deep. I don't<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
know as you can blame 'em, miss. I suppose
it's a microbe. I myself have just refused
three marriages and two guilty loves."</p>

<p>"I shall have to leave you to manage the
orphans, Sarah." Evelyn smiled an odd
smile. "I myself am going to be married
and start off on a honeymoon immediately."</p>

<p>"You don't say, miss!" The maid raised
her eyebrows. "Well, a common soldier is
hardly in the same social class as my own
Scotch intended, with a literary turn and a
copper proposition, but I will say that Sergeant
Scarlett looks and acts quite the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not Sergeant Scarlett! It is the
Mr. Travers who looked after us so civilly
aboard the Skagway boat."</p>

<p>Sarah's eyebrow's went up further still.
"Indeed, miss! He's very smart in his dress,
yet&mdash;however, I suppose everything goes in
a country where no one minds the clocks."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the assistance of Ikey,
Maclane, having covered the funereal sled
with the Stars and Stripes loaned by Gumboot
Annie, drew it across to poor Walter's
own side of the dividing line, that his mortal
remains might rest in their native soil.</p>

<p>When he came to seek Evelyn, to consult
her about the last rites, she met him with a
strange request, to the effect that first he<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
should unite her with all despatch and secrecy
to one Mr. Horatio Travers, whom she
then and there presented to him.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady!" The minister
stared at her. "Isn't this decision very sudden?
Forgive my interference, but you
being alone up here, and so young&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-two," Evelyn assured him,
"and that's middle-aged for a New York
girl."</p>

<p>In spite of the bravado of her manner, her
tone so wholly lacked all bridal joyousness
that Maclane was impelled to draw her
aside and ask: "Is this act of your own free
will?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, yes!" she asserted, confidently.
"No one on earth could make me do anything
I didn't choose to."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," the minister demurred,
"let me entreat you to defer so important a
step till you can consult your father."</p>

<p>"It is my father's desire, expressed with
an emphasis that makes it almost a command,"
averred Evelyn, solemnly. "And
conveyed to me at the price of that poor
lad's life."</p>

<p>Still dissatisfied, but without sufficing reason
for refusing, Maclane put the usual
questions to the prospective groom. As
witness, Travers introduced old Blenksoe,<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
who, having disposed of Durant, had ambled
up, calling him a dear old family retainer&mdash;a
lifelong friend.</p>

<p>"That's me," corroborated the old sinner.
"Rough an' ready, but allus in it with Raish.
Not only is Raish by nature and eddication
fitted to adorn the proudest spear, but he's
a square proposition. Ye kin safely leave
it ter Raish, every time."</p>

<p>"Well," reluctantly the minister consented,
"where is your license?"</p>

<p>"A license!" exclaimed Travers. "What
for?"</p>

<p>"To legalize the marriage," Maclane instructed
him. "You must get one from
the Gold Commissioner or Justice of the
Peace."</p>

<p>"Then that queers the show," stated old
Blenksoe, "sence thar ain't no gold round
these here diggings, nor no justice, nor no
peace."</p>

<p>"Is there no way of dispensing with it,
under exceptional circumstances?" Evelyn
asked, anxiously. "If you knew how imperative
my reason for desiring haste&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In lieu of it, then," the minister conceded,
"I will accept a copy of the appropriate
clause of the Dominion Marriage Act,
signed by the Mounted Policeman in charge
of the district where Miss Durant resides."<span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>And before Raish, who sprang forward,
with an oath, could stop him, he had entered
the Customs building, calling for Sergeant
Scarlett.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<h2><a id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<p class="h3">NORTHERN LIGHTS</p>

<p>Scarlett looked from Evelyn to
Travers and back again, in bewilderment,
dismay. "Miss Durant," he at
last found voice to say, "surely there is some
mistake! Surely there's no love lost between
ye and this&mdash;gentleman!"</p>

<p>"My private affairs, my feelings, seem to
cause a great deal of unnecessary comment,"
remarked Evelyn, hiding her emotion
under a mask of irony. "May I beg
you to refrain from criticism, and to give
us the requisite authority?"</p>

<p>Scarlett looked at her fixedly, and seeing
her control weaken, her color change, and
her eyes fill and falter beneath his penetrating
gaze, shook his head. "That I must absolutely
decline to do!"</p>

<p>"And why, pray?" she commanded herself
to ask.</p>

<p>"Oh, the reason is plain!" Raish sneeringly
interposed. "Every one knows the<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
Sergeant's own matrimonial aspirations.
Every one has heard of the cheap device by
which on the very day of her arrival he tried
to worm himself into the favor of my
fianc&eacute;e. If he did but know it, her father's
chief reason for insisting on the immediate
celebration of our marriage is to protect her
from the persecutions of adventurers!"</p>

<p>"I beg," cried Evelyn, checking Scarlett's
furious retort, "that there may be no such
personalities! Mr. Travers, pray understand
that I do not, in the least, assent to your
characterization of the Sergeant, who, up
to this moment, has treated me and my
friends with the utmost delicate consideration
and chivalry!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, dearest"&mdash;Raish took her
hand. "I spoke too warmly! Yet who could
blame me? Come, come, my good Sergeant,
put your name to that paper without further
ado, unless you wish to suffer under
the imputation of sacrificing official honor
to personal revenge."</p>

<p>Not deigning to heed the taunt, Scarlett
turned to the minister. "I can't sign, because
down in yonder valley is a lass in a
red cloak who has a prior claim upon this
man."</p>

<p>Raish forced a contemptuous laugh. "The
red-cloak, who should not even be mentioned<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
in this presence, may stay in the valley
for me. My acquaintance with the red-cloak
belongs to a day before I knew Evelyn.
She condones the past, accepts the
dedication of my future life." Drawing Evelyn
aside, he whispered, "Don't be alarmed.
My pledge holds good. This is all bluff, my
doing the devoted, to throw them off the
track." Stooping suddenly he kissed her.</p>

<p>"My young friend," Maclane restrained
and admonished Scarlett, "my sympathies
are yours wholly. But are you not exceeding
your authority?"</p>

<p>"Aye," confessed the Irishman, "I'm
stretching it a bit, maybe, to fit me intuitions.
Dominie, I tell ye 'tis a fishy business.
Not an hour since, the girl was in
these arms of mine, lip to lip, and liking it.
And now, look at her shudder at that fellow's
touch."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Scarlett"&mdash;breaking from
Raish, Evelyn came to him and laid a coaxing
hand upon his arm&mdash;"I know that in
your heart you are despising me for a cheap
coquette. And I deserve it. I have given
you cause to think the worst of me. I can't
explain. But if you could only read my
heart&mdash;could only know what this means to
me&mdash;it's the happiness of my life! It will
be misery to the end of my days if I fail him<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
at this supreme test. You're magnanimous,
above all pettiness, I know. You simply
want to save me, as you think, from making
a mistake. But believe me, trust me, I
know what I'm about. Now, will you do me
the greatest favor one human being ever entreated
of another, by signing your name
to that document?"</p>

<p>Scarlett looked tenderly down on her,
and, swayed against his judgment by her
earnestness, he might have yielded, had not
the Dandy inopportunely added the word
too much.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Scarlett will hardly dare take
the consequences of refusing when I tell
him that without the protection of my name
Miss Durant will be irretrievably compromised!"</p>

<p>Scarlett checked an almost overwhelming
impulse to kick the speaker. Instead,
he took Evelyn's cold fingers into his honest
grasp. "I'd give my name to shield ye,
my life to serve ye, and now I'm going to
risk my official honor, to&mdash;as I think, to save
ye." He tore up the paper.</p>

<p>Above the general outcry that ensued,
Sarah's tones were heard. "A pretty country
where you can't marry whom you please!
America's good enough for me!"</p>

<p>"America!" exclaimed Evelyn, struck by<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
a sudden thought. "Are there such restrictions
with us in America?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately not, my dear," replied
Maclane, who had once occupied a Chicago
pastorate. "In the States the sacred tie is
made and broken far more easily."</p>

<p>"Then, quick," she cried, "across the boundary!"
And seizing Travers' hand she ran,
the others following breathlessly, not halting
till she reached the tall mast from
which proudly floated the emblem of the
free.</p>

<p>"God in Heaven!" Scarlett looked after
her, his personal grief swallowed up in anxiety.
"Is there no power above, below, to
stop a wilful woman from cutting her own
throat with a wedding-ring?" He cast about
for aid. Barney, who might have thrown
some light on the plot, had returned to
duties at headquarters, but Nick and Gelly
might yet be reached in time, and for them
he sent messengers flying. Meanwhile, he
bethought himself of Chilkat Jo. Sheltered
by the Customs water-butt, he found the
trader squatting peaceably, whittling a
mimic totem-pole. On his shoulder Scarlett
laid a gauntleted hand. "Chilkat Jo, man,
look what devil's work is going on forninst
ye! Can't ye say the word to stop it?"</p>

<p>There was an appreciable pause while,<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
with a silken sound, the soft shavings
curled, fell, under the skilful knife. Then
without looking up, the Siwash gently replied,
"Me no such godam-hellan-blazes
Clistian fool! Laish mally Missy Dulant! I
mally Gelly!"</p>

<p>In desperation Scarlett strode toward the
bridal group, reaching it just as the minister's
solemn tones rolled forth, challenging
the wilderness to show just cause or impediment
why these two persons might not lawfully
be joined together.</p>

<p>"Just or unjust," he shouted, "sure it's
myself will furnish the impediment"&mdash;as,
collaring the bridegroom, with a series of
violent jerks he sent him flying back into
precincts that rendered him amenable to
Dominion law, where he neatly knocked him
down, and sat on him. "Now, I've got ye in
my own jurisdiction, I'll detain ye as a suspicious
person till evidence for or against
ye is forthcoming!" Maclane's protests,
Evelyn's tears, Sarah's shrieks and taunts,
and old Blenksoe's curses were as unavailing
as Raish's struggles; the young giant
held the position by main force till Nick,
who had been easily overtaken, by courtesy
of his custodians arrived in response to the
recall.</p>

<p>"There, there," Scarlett soothed the<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
squirming Dandy. "If I find I'm mistaken;
if that damned incriminating face of yours
belies ye, sure I'll apologize in sackcloth and
give ye the satisfaction of a gentleman."
Jerking Travers to his feet, he confronted
him with Gelly's father. "Nick," he inquired,
"what is your unvarnished opinion
of this fellow?"</p>

<p>"Wa'al, thar's things in his past," admitted
the Bully, "same as in most men's,
thet you wouldn't hold up as a shinin' example
to a Sunday-school, d'ye see? But
bygones is bygones. Arter wot he projected
ter-day, I've nought but good words fer
Dandy Raish."</p>

<p>"Not another syllable, Nick, I beg," Travers
hastened to cut short the Bully's elogium
at a period so favorable to his plans.
"Now, Sergeant, we accept your apology for
your ill-directed zeal, and dispense with
your further company."</p>

<p>"Say, Scarlett," wrathfully demanded
Nick, "I kin cheek yer now I'm goin' ter be
hanged by U. S. law! Take yer hands off'n
Raish! Wot the hell d'ye mean by damagin'
my son-in-law?"</p>

<p>"Your son-in-law?" in one breath cried
Evelyn, Sarah and Maclane.</p>

<p>"I sent my gal a letter," elucidated
Nick. "Your pop Lucky put it in writin'<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
fer me, Missy. That's it you got in your
hand."</p>

<p>"This letter! And that villain made me
believe&mdash;&mdash; Oh, oh, oh!" Evelyn burst into
a flood of humiliated tears.</p>

<p>"You black scoundrel; you'd 'a' deceived
her as you deceived my gal!" Nick made a
blind rush at Raish, but was held back by
his custodians. "Sure as thar's a God in
Heaven, Raish," he vowed, as they restrained
him, "I'll live ter kill ye yet!"</p>

<p>Vain threat! A sharp sound cleft the
crystal air and, echoing, died away in soft
detonations among the hills. The Dandy
threw up his hands as he had forced so
many luckless travelers to do in his career
of highway robbery, and fell, gracefully, as
he did everything, face downward, with a
little trickle of blood, upon the snow. With
a shriek of anguish a girl in a red cloak, who
had been speeding up the hill, threw herself
beside him, calling his name with all the
loving epithets that even the lowest of the
low seems able to win from some woman's
heart.</p>

<p>Tears wrung from his being's depths for
baffled retribution coursing down his rough
cheeks, the Bully lifted pinioned hands to
Heaven and uttered the one prayer of his
life: "O Almighty Gawd, with all respect,<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
why did You butt in? O Gawd! I've made
cold meat of a score o' men on end
from fust ter last! But they was jes'
accident or playfulness, d'ye see? This here
skunk were the only livin' thing I ever hankered
fer ter kill! And Thou hast called my
bluff, and took the wind outen my sails by
puttin' the shootin'-iron of my vengeance
inter another's hand! Thar ain't no four-flushin'
Thee, O Gawd! Thou hast plumb
squared the reckonin' fer all my sins, past
and ter come, world without end. Amen."</p>

<p>Whose the hand that shot Dandy Raish
no one ever knew, though many a young
fool, in his cups, boasted of the high distinction.
In the case of a man so universally
detested perhaps official enquiry thought
it policy to rest. But, possessed at the moment
by a literal interpretation of duty,
with a heavy heart the good minister
sought his favorite Indian proselyte.</p>

<p>Sitting beside him, where he found him
whittling peaceably in the shelter of the
Customs water-butt, "O Joseph, Chilkat
Jo," sighing, he began. "My son, if on your
hands there be blood-guiltiness, you must repent,
confess!"</p>

<p>The soft shavings slithered, curled and
fell, as the emblem of the Raven and the
Frog grew beneath the skilful knife. Then,<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
in unimpassioned monotone, the Indian remarked,
"Some day, when I velly old, old
chief, I lepent, confess, make godam-hellan-blazes
Clistian deathbed. But now&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused to twist the weird features of his
tribal god into an inscrutable smile. "Now,
I mally Gelly."</p>

<p>It was the cool of the evening. From behind
the mountains northern lights shot up
in streamers of living green and rose. There
was a sound of bells, and "mushing," as the
drivers harnessed up their dog-teams to
carry the picnickers back to camp. Scarlett
looked over at Evelyn with an odd contraction
of the heart, where the bud of hope was
trembling for life under the icy hand of circumstance,
but as she did not appear to
notice him he turned and went on his own
road without farewell.</p>

<p>Then Evelyn went to Gelly where, the violence
of her grief spent, she still crouched
beside her lover's stiffening form. Putting
an arm about her, "Come. Come home with
me to live," she said. "Yes." For Gelly
looked up with resentment changing to incredulity.
"Please. As a favor to me. I
have so much to learn. I need you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[187]</span></p>

<h2><a id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<p class="h3">A YEAR AFTER</p>

<p>Winter had come and gone; spring
had passed into a new summer.
In the prosperous township of
Lost Shoe Creek no one would have recognized
the god-forsaken camp of the year before.
While the locality was generally condemned
as an auriferous proposition, its
situation fitted it admirably for base of supplies
to other creeks: Abe Lincoln, Jubilee,
Old Glory and Princess May, where hydraulic
machinery had been established and
placer claims were being worked with profitable,
if not phenomenal, results.</p>

<p>Some critics attributed the marvelous
transformation that had taken place to the
presence of women, dating from the arrival
of Evelyn and her party; others to the gospel
tidings of good-will brought by Parson
Maclane, when, wild rose in buttonhole, and
followed by his dogs, Telegraph and Wrangel,
he came running on the trail. A third<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
faction was for giving the credit to law and
order, personified by the ubiquitous young
soldier, Sergeant Scarlett, and his right-hand
man, Barney. But the wise set it down
to the trinity of saving influences.</p>

<p>For Evelyn the time had been one of unusual
happiness. Learning early that the
boundless wealth of which she supposed
herself possessor was not a popular subject
among folk to whom daily bread came hardly,
she wisely decided to omit mention of it
from her conversation. Also, finding herself
likely to be embarrassed for ready money,
since credit was denied her, she followed
Scarlett's excellent advice to try roughing
it, with excellent results. Moreover, at the
suggestion of the good Graysons, whose
neighborliness she soon learned to value,
and loyally backed by the "boys," she
opened a real-estate office at Lost Shoe
Creek, with a branch at Perdu, showing herself
an admirable business woman. Amateur
theatricals, concerts, and ice-carnivals
had brightened the dark season, when mining-camps
in the North are as desert islands,
cut off from all communication with the outside;
and for the first time in her life Evelyn
tasted the unalloyed pleasure that springs
from giving pleasure and helpfulness that
money cannot buy. One sorrow only dimmed
<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>her sky: the continued absence of her father.
No one told her that, far and wide, official
search was being made for Matthew Durant,
nicknamed Lucky, who, on a fateful day of
the previous summer had disappeared as
utterly as had the earth in which he worked
opened to engulf him; she still believed, uncontradicted,
that his vast interests were detaining
him somewhere among the baffling
distances of snow-capped hills, and that any
hour that suited him would bring him back
to her.</p>

<p class="caption">THE UBIQUITOUS YOUNG SOLDIER, SERGEANT SCARLETT.</p>

<p>It was the day when, by the most lovable
of paradoxes, in that region, two festivals&mdash;one
of independence declared, one of allegiance
covenanted&mdash;are celebrated, with
crossed flags: Dominion Day and the Fourth
of July, in one.</p>

<p>On this particular anniversary gala preparations
of extra splendor were afoot in
honor of the return of Bully Nick, once
more a free man, not because in equity he
was held worthy to be at large, so much as
through a technical slip by which but six
jurors had been requisitioned to sit on his
case, whereas, as his backers claimed, he
was territorially entitled to be adjudged
guilty by a full dozen good men and true.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm dazzled fer fair," announced
the hero, as, amid cheers from his friends<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
and followers, he alighted from the stage.
"This here bloomin' Paradise ain't never
Lost Shoe Creek."</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis! Betcherboots! That's what!"
he was assured.</p>

<p>Nick rubbed astonished eyes. "By gum, a
Gospel-mill!"</p>

<p>"Aye, and filled to overflowing every Sabbath,
Nicholas," proudly stated good Maclane.</p>

<p>"Wa'al, y' see," Mops hastened to apologize
to his leader for this hated concession
to religion, "the gals like piousness."</p>

<p>The neat jail next the church was described
by Barney as "just an impty forrum
intoirely, owing to the ladies' distaste for
the spacies of bird such cages are controived
for, begorra!"</p>

<p>The decorative touch to the personal appearance
of his followers, in honor of the
holiday, naturally came in for the Bully's
quizzical attention: their shorn faces; the
soap "with the tony smell" in vogue; the paper
collars with jeweled studs in which, all
day, Ikey had been doing a rushing trade,
were noted by him categorically till Bill silenced
him by stating that "style was like
for to fetch the girls."</p>

<p>Gumboot Annie, to whose hostelry he was
conducted to drink his own health, had been<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
allowed to reopen, he was informed, under
close restriction and surveillance from
"that blamed Scarlett." Nevertheless, as
she told Nick, spitting with deliberation,
not being in business for salubrious ends
merely, she was making great profit out of
"moderate drinkin' and no drunks," through
the girls' preference for sober cavaliers. Or,
as she phrased it, "the gals won't swaller
the booze."</p>

<p>This was too much for the Bully's equanimity.
"The gals, indeed!" Slapping his
knee, he chuckled. "The hell!"</p>

<p>"Eh, Nicholas?" the minister challenged
him. "Did I understand you to say 'the
hell?'"</p>

<p>"The hell you did, Parson!" The Bully
turned on him truculently. "And what the
hell hev you agin it?"</p>

<p>"If no better argument, Nicholas," smiled
Maclane, "the girls won't stand for hell."</p>

<p>"Parson," Nick acknowledged his defeat,
"the drinks is on me." Later he took occasion
to state, "I ain't convarted. But, say,
Parson, you're jes' the squarest proposition
Gawd ever grub-staked ter prospect fer human
souls, and, say&mdash;I won't oppose you
none. And when I pass in my checks jes'
you stand by my grave, and put up a little
prayer fer my epitaffy, 'He done his level<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
damnedest, angels cud no more. Amen.'"
Then he took from Gelly's arms the fine infant
she had brought to show him, described
by its fond father as "a velly godam skukum
Clistian baby." Dandling it tenderly, "See
here, son," he adjured it, "ef I find indications
of you takin' arter me&mdash;gamblin', cussin',
drinkin',&mdash;why, grandpop 'ull spankee,
d'ye see?"</p>

<p>His mind thus freed, his future pacific
course outlined, Nick inquired, circumstantially
for "the girls." Sarah, he learned, was
the great lady of the place, making a large
income as a "lady-barber," her firm hand,
unshaken as her masculine competitors
were apt to be by sprees, making her a peculiarly
safe artist to be trusted to operate
with a razor in the region of the jugular,
and her husband's copper proposition still
remaining an undeveloped asset, she was
forcing him to work for regular wage as a
teamster. In spite of which, on his occasional
lapses Sandy was wont to boast that
at heart he was "a mon for a' that."</p>

<p>The orphans all had settled down; Mary,
having discovered a new violet at the foot
of a glacier, had paired off with the young
botanist who had been sent out from Ottawa
to report on the flora of the region. Ruth
was running postoffice and postmaster.<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
Ethel and the town doctor had made a
match. Kate's lot was cast with Bill, now
doing assessment work and writing to his
mother regularly. Effie had pre-empted
the young editor of the weekly <i>Claim</i>,
helping both to write his editorials
and set them up in type. Gertrude had
struck it rich with the bank manager. All
would be on hand at the ball to-night. No,
Evelyn had not made a choice. Rumor assigned
her to Scarlett, yet how matters
stood between them no man could say with
certainty.</p>

<p>At this the Bully's eye took on a fiery
glow. "Ef thet thar uniformed cuss is
a-playin' fast an' loose with Lucky's gal,
d'ye see, it's up ter me to set it straight!"
And, forthwith, he led the way to Evelyn's
bower.</p>

<p>Evelyn was found, outside her cabin, superintending
the arrangements for a grand
display of fireworks in honor of the double
holiday; the crowning piece to show the two
flags crossed beneath a wondrous rainbow.
By a coincidence that exactly suited the Bully's
plans, Scarlett was, at the minute, seen
approaching. After greetings had been interchanged
with all heartiness, suddenly the
young soldier found himself surrounded by
the men&mdash;Nick, in the center, pointing a<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
gun at his heart. Evelyn shrieked, and
would have interposed, but was forced back
by hands roughly tender, tenderly peremptory.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," asked Scarlett, calmly, "is
this some new kind of game?"</p>

<p>"Thet's as mebbe," answered Nick. "See
here, Missy Durant, it ain't human natur
fer a gal ter stay single in a minin'-camp."</p>

<p>"That's what!" the boys interrupted him
to say.</p>

<p>"And I reckon you've had your pick of
every miner an' prospector in the district&mdash;aye,
and loafer, worthy of the name!"</p>

<p>"Sure! Betcherlife!" the boys confirmed
him.</p>

<p>"Now," concluded the Bully, magnificently,
"the question we're debatin' is jes' this:
Hev you give this here blamed Scarlett the
mitten, or hev you not?"</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed merrily. "To tell the
truth, Nick, he hasn't given the opportunity&mdash;as
yet."</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't take it if she gave it me,"
added the soldier, referring to the mitten.</p>

<p>The Bully looked from one to the other,
and, in spite of their enigmatic replies, reading
in the glances they exchanged some
happy understanding, surrendered for good
and all.<span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>"Boys," he announced, "the drinks, as
usual, is on us when we run up agin the
church, perlice, and gals&mdash;Here, Parson."
He handed his weapon to Maclane who,
fearing trouble, had hurried to the spot.
"Keep this here shootin'-iron. I ain't fit ter
be trusted with it, d'ye see? When I want
a shot at moose or ptarmigan I'll borrow the
loan of it from you."</p>

<p>"That's what! Betcherlife!" applauded
the boys.</p>

<p>When, at last, they found themselves left
together, Evelyn held up a mocking finger
at her lover. "To think you had to be coerced!
For shame!"</p>

<p>"I wanted to give ye time," he explained,
"to feel surer of yourself and me."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she exclaimed. "You feared
I might suspect you of interested motives.
But the surest proof of my love for you has
been my certainty that you care for me for
myself alone, not for what I bring."</p>

<p>"That's the sweetest thing that ever has
come from your lips," announced the soldier.
"Not another word till I taste a
sweeter."</p>

<p>He was about to illustrate his meaning
when Barney's voice was heard, discreetly
inquiring of the landscape for "himself."</p>

<p>Affecting, for the first time, to perceive<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
his superior, "Och, are ye there, sorr?" saluting,
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Here or there, I'm beside myself with
joy," remarked Scarlett <i>sotto voce</i>. "Well,
Barney, what's that you bring?"</p>

<p>"If appearances are not desayving, sorr,
I'm thinking 'tis a letther. Our rint-roll,
I'm thinking." He stood by with an air of
partnership while Scarlett opened the envelope.</p>

<p>"Your rent-roll!" Puzzled, Evelyn looked
at the address. "'Sir Gerald Scarlett.' Is
that some joke?"</p>

<p>"A hereditary wan, begorra," Barney hastened
to assure her. "It runs in our family."</p>

<p>"More roll than rent, though." Scarlett
held out to her a long, legally drawn-up
document.</p>

<p>"Not to mintion the castle," remarked
Barney.</p>

<p>"Just a ruin in a bit of a potato patch,"
Scarlett hastened to apologize for his ancestral
glories.</p>

<p>"And a cow to chaperon it&mdash;God bless
her!" Barney saluted respectfully, as he
turned to go.</p>

<p>Sir Gerald looked down on his lady-love
with laughing eyes.</p>

<p>"My offence is rank," he quoted.<span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's not an unpardonable sin," Evelyn
assured him, also laughing, but confused.
"What a goose you must have
thought me all this time&mdash;the way I have
condescended to you!"</p>

<p>"The greater my triumph in winning you
on my own recognizances," he replied.</p>

<p>Evelyn held him at arms' length, contemplatively.
"What a difference," she remarked,
"between the myself of to-day and
of a year ago! Then I should have suspected
myself of being influenced by this&mdash;but now
nothing seems to matter so much as that we
care for each other."</p>

<p>"Miss Durant! O Miss Durant!" The lovers
broke apart as, by a cross-cut through
the bushes, the minister came hurrying toward
them. "Here is&mdash;some one who brings
you news of your father."</p>

<p>He pointed to an elderly man who, with
lagging footstep, followed him.</p>

<p>"Of daddy? Hurrah!" Evelyn clapped her
hands. "That was the one thing needed to
complete my happiness! How is he? And
where? Why hasn't he come to me himself?"
she demanded impatiently of the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Our friend here has traveled far," Maclane
gently reminded her. "He is worn and
spent."<span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, how thoughtless I am!" As Evelyn
placed the newcomer in a comfortable chair
she noticed that his features, as she saw
them between his slouch hat and heavy
beard, were pinched, and that his frame was
bowed beyond his years, as if from recent
suffering. "How tired you look! You have
been ill?" she asked him considerately.</p>

<p>"He has undergone great hardships for
the sake of a dearly loved daughter," Maclane
hastened to explain. "He has escaped
with but little besides his life. But for that
let us give thanks. Let us make him feel
that, so long as he is spared, his daughter
will not mind poverty."</p>

<p>"To be sure!" Evelyn tried not to show
the impatience she felt at the concerns of
outsiders being placed before her own, with
a touch of her old patronizing manner adding,
"And I dare say my father and I can
arrange matters so that this good man's
daughter need not complain of poverty."</p>

<p>The stranger opened his lips to speak, but
unable to command himself, turned his head
aside with a slight groan.</p>

<p>With an inexplicable foreboding, Evelyn
looked from him to Maclane, and in the latter's
kind eyes reading a deep pity, "What
is wrong?" she faltered. "Has anything
happened to my father?"<span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>"Nothing that sympathy and loving care
cannot cure," replied the minister. "Mr. Durant
was on his way to you a year ago when
he fell into the power of ruffians, even as
Travers, for his own evil purposes, informed
you. After serious ill-treatment at their
hands he escaped, but so broken in mind
and body that for months he wandered
about, unable to fix his own identity or put
himself in communication with his friends.
Now, thank God, he is almost cured."</p>

<p>"He shall be completely so, if, as you say,
love can accomplish it." Evelyn started up.
"I'll go to him at once." She addressed the
stranger. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"First&mdash;&mdash;" Again Maclane hurriedly interposed.
"There is something you should
know about your father's finances. He is
not rich, as you think him. By incessant
toil from time to time he used to make vast
sums, as miners are apt to do&mdash;and as miners
are apt to do, he spent as fast as he
made, his one extravagance being your
pleasure. But the inexhaustible supply, the
purse of Fortunatus&mdash;that was a fable that
somehow grew up between your romanticism
and his optimism. It does not exist.
It never has existed. To-day he is absolutely
penniless."</p>

<p>The words rained on her like hailstones.<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
Evelyn met them, standing erect, very white
and still.</p>

<p>At last, "I do not grasp your meaning,"
she replied. "Every one in the district knows
that my father is a very rich man."</p>

<p>"Not so." Maclane shook his head. "Every
one knows the reverse; has always
known it. Believe me, my child, what I
tell you is true."</p>

<p>"My father's wealth does not exist." Evelyn's
mind seemed to take slow, cautious
steps backward over the minister's statements,
with every impact feeling surer of
the truth. "To-day he is absolutely penniless.
Every one knows it; has always known
it. Then why," she demanded with sudden
passion, "has it been kept from me?"</p>

<p>"Out of kindness," replied Maclane, simply.</p>

<p>"Kindness!" Evelyn laughed scornfully,
hysterically; calmed herself, then laughed
again. "Kindness! When I recall how I
used to brag of what my wealth would do
for the place&mdash;and all the time, poor fool
that I am, I have been the laughing-stock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Again not so," emphatically said Maclane.
"Think how quickly you fell into our
primitive ways, becoming the heart and
spirit of the camp. Believe me, Evelyn, you<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
have endeared yourself, accomplished a
thousand times as much by this year's
bread-winning toil and good-fellowship as
had you been the Lady Bountiful you started
out to be. It isn't money that builds up
camps, closing dives and opening reading-rooms&mdash;it's
neighborliness&mdash;working and
suffering with people, side by side. And in
all his grief, remorse for your bitter disappointment,
your poor father may take this
comfort: that it has been the making of you
as a woman, just as you, the real woman,
have been the making of the camp."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Evelyn spoke in a hard little
dry voice. "Some day I may bring myself
to see it in that light." She took a few
steps to and fro, then came to a standstill
opposite the minister. "Mr. Maclane, I want
you to give my love to the 'boys'&mdash;to all
who, by their silence, have shielded me as
they thought, from the painful truth. Tell
them that I appreciate it. Also ask them to
try not to show that they pity me. I'm going
to do something that's not easy for me.
It would be easiest to go away to a strange
place, where I could hide my head&mdash;but I
have my poor father to think of. I have a
good business here, which will support us
both decently, at least. I shall bring him
here to care for him&mdash;and mind! not one<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
word of reproach, or mockery, is he ever to
hear from any one! Not one word!"</p>

<p>"Bravely spoken," cried Maclane. "Oh,
there's happiness in store for you, my child.
You'll see."</p>

<p>"Together, sweetheart!" Scarlett, who
had been standing by in mute distress for
her great trouble, now came to her and took
her hand. "We'll fight it out together&mdash;you
and I."</p>

<p>"Oh, no." Evelyn wrenched her hand
from him. "That is all over. Things are
changed with me. My eyes are open at last.
I can forgive every one but you, Sir Gerald
Scarlett&mdash;you who let me condescend to
you, lead you on&mdash;and finally almost do the
asking!"</p>

<p>"Faith, your eyes may be open, but they
don't see as straight as they did when
closed," Scarlett indignantly contradicted
her. "I've loved ye all along, and sooner;
since the moment I saw your picture smiling
up to me among the roses."</p>

<p>"We won't discuss it. I only know"&mdash;Evelyn's
voice broke&mdash;"I never want to see
you again."</p>

<p>"But if only I could make people understand&mdash;believe
in me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stranger, who, all this time, had been
sitting bowed forward, his face buried in his<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
hands, suddenly broke forth. "It's not a
fable! The Rainbow Mine&mdash;it's <i>true!</i> I discovered
it the day&mdash;but where&mdash;where&mdash;where?
My God, where?" He looked about
wildly.</p>

<p>Evelyn turned sharply on the speaker.
"Who are you?"</p>

<p>Matthew Durant, his passion spent, lifted
streaming eyes to his daughter's face.
"Don't you know me, Evie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! You're not&mdash;oh, daddy!"
Falling on her knees beside him, she gathered
the feeble form into her strong young
arms.</p>

<p>Then Maclane led Scarlett quietly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<h2><a id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<p class="h3">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Within the cabin her father was
resting peacefully. While eating
the food she set before him, he
told Evelyn the history of his wonderful discovery,
as it came back, fragmentarily, to
his blurred memory, and she, the better to
bring him back, as she thought, to sanity,
humored his delusion by not betraying incredulity.</p>

<p>At the mission where he had been tended
during the long illness that followed his
captivity, so he explained, he had purposely
given a fictitious name and account of himself,
lest the truth should somehow reach
Blenksoe, thus furnishing the clue to the
whereabouts of the unstaked mine, which
precaution also accounted for his having
eluded the diligent search that the Mounted
Police had never ceased to prosecute since
his disappearance. From Blenksoe, however,
he had no longer anything to fear; that<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
arch-conspirator having gone the way of his
leader, Dandy Raish, by the avenging bullet
from some victim's hand.</p>

<p>And, now, please God, he concluded, restored
health would bring back recollection,
enabling him to unearth the pot of gold to
which the heavenly sign had pointed him.</p>

<p>When, at last, her loving tendance had
won him to sleep, Evelyn went out into the
cool air, to draw a long breath and readjust
her reckonings with life that the day's
events had thus cruelly disturbed.</p>

<p>It was the sunset's glowing aftermath
that, to the pilgrims of the north, alone justifies
a long journey from conditions that
those hide-bound with conventions are inclined
to associate with creature comfort,
opening a new wonderland of beauty. In
such regions where nature is elemental, man
becomes elementary, feeling himself in the
Almighty's workshop, in close communication
with the powers of life, dealt with, not
by subtle processes that the artificial conditions
of city life have engendered, but
swiftly, directly, summarily, as in the days
of burning bush and pillars of flame.</p>

<p>Gazing over the now prosperous township
of Lost Shoe Creek, across the lake, to the
colossal mountains shutting it in from that
"outside," to which even miners so heavily<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
under the mysterious spell of the North that
nothing ever could induce them to forsake
it, still never ceases fondly to speak of as
"God's country," Evelyn seemed to herself
to be born again. Had she known it, it was
then that she attained the noblest moment
of her being, resolving, even as she already
had resolved to meet it bravely, also to
meet this uncompromising blow of providence
without bitterness; if possible with
love.</p>

<p>Hearing Durant move within, she was
about to go to him when her attention was
arrested by a tatterdemalion figure at her
gate, beseeching charity.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;peety ze poor!"</p>

<p>"Alphonse!" she exclaimed, recognizing
the once jaunty person of her former courier,
alias Count St. Hilaire.</p>

<p>Alphonse, who had not thought of her
from that day to this, in turn recognizing
her, hastened to attribute his present pitiful
plight as the deserved vengeance of an outraged
Heaven for his baseness in despoiling
one of its own angels of kodak and motorcar.
"But," he wept, "zese fruits of sin did
not long time 'dure. Ze automobile she bust,
zen I bust&mdash;and now&mdash;I have a such hunger."</p>

<p>In spite of the weight of sadness at her<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
heart, Evelyn could not but smile. It was
one of the jests of the great powers&mdash;jests
that are, nevertheless, always tinged with
irony, this confronting her with the scarecrow
of her whilom splendor at the supreme
hour of her misery.</p>

<p>Grateful for food which he devoured
eagerly, overwhelmed by the gift of a small
sum she bestowed on him to enable him to
prosecute his journey, Alphonse sought
some expression of his feelings beyond his
mere copious Gallic thanks. He was selling
photographs for a living, and he besought
mademoiselle, could she bring herself to
overlook the regrettable fact that they were
the product of her own camera, to accept
the choicest example of his art&mdash;a veritable
triumph, an arc-en-ciel&mdash;a rainbow!</p>

<p>Involuntarily, Evelyn shuddered at the
word. Would the gods never cease their
mocking sport, she wondered, even while
with becoming graciousness she thanked
Alphonse and sent him on his way, rejoicing.
She still held the picture in her hand,
carelessly, occupied with her thoughts, when
she heard a cry from Durant, who had come
out without her noticing him, and was looking
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"My God! Evelyn! Look," he cried. "The
mine&mdash;The Rainbow!"<span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>"Father, dear," she sought to soothe him,
"it is nothing&mdash;merely a chance photograph."</p>

<p>"Nothing? It is my witness, my record,"
answered Durant. "No, Evie, I'm not mad.
This clears away the last cloud. Examine it
carefully." Getting out his prospector's
glass, he polished the lens carefully and
held it over the photograph.</p>

<p>Evelyn looked, as she was bidden, at first
merely to humor him, then with awakening
interest as, under the glass's magnifying
power, she studied the picture in detail. In
his passion for the picturesque Alphonse
had, indeed, put her camera to good use. In
this composition he had caught a striking
moment: Durant himself, in his rough miner's
garb, standing with arms flung up, as
if in thankfulness to Heaven, while near
by, beside a half-uprooted willow-bush,
knelt Walter Pierce with an expression of
wonder on his young face; while in the
background, beyond the creek, stood the imperturbable
mountains, spanned by a faint,
elusive rainbow.</p>

<p>"This is the very spot!" Durant laughed
like a happy boy. "Lost Shoe Creek! Fancy
forgetting even the name!&mdash;I had always believed
in it, though every other miner turned
it down. It had shared the fate of hundreds<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
of other northern camps: a new strike; a
stampede, prospectors, traders, grafters,
from all quarters rushing madly in; then,
disappointment, failure, starvation, desertion
to new fields. It became the most god-forsaken
place on earth&mdash;an abandoned
camp drained of everything but the dregs of
its population. I alone held on, having a
nose for gold, and scenting it right here, and
now and then coming on indications: Blenksoe,
Raish, and all the other grafters meanwhile
dogging my steps to profit by any
strike I might make, jump my claim, and
make away with me!&mdash;Oh, this brings it all
back, this picture: Walter Pierce; your
coming; how Nick and the boys covered up
my humiliation; my trying to kill myself;
and then&mdash;the gold!"</p>

<p>While he was speaking, he had hurried to
the clearing at the back of the cabin, comparing
the lay of the land with the picture,
Evelyn following with keenest anxiety at
this new phase of his delusion, yet not knowing
how to restrain him.</p>

<p>"Father, dear, don't," she remonstrated,
seeing him uprooting a willow with frenzied
eagerness. "Why, that's the bush on which
I spread out my wash."</p>

<p>But Durant only laughed and went on
spading up the soft earth with a bit of<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
wood. Wild as were his actions, his face
and bearing had regained all their old, light-hearted
poise. He was as Evelyn always
had known him on his occasional visits to
her, when they spent money like princes
and amused themselves like children.</p>

<p>Soon he threw his improvised tool aside.
"Here we are! Look at this, Evie!"</p>

<p>Evelyn took the substance he handed to
her, and, as the earth crumbled from it, saw
that it was of irregular shape, and oddly indented,
as though some underground giant
had chewed it with Titanic teeth before
spewing it up for man's good or ill, as fate
might decree. A slight, bluish hue with
which it first met the eye melted softly into
that indefinable lustre that proclaims gold
and only gold&mdash;the lust for which is more
potent than the love of woman, wine; in
whose quest more lives have been sacrificed
than for any other cause since the world began;
for whose possession souls innumerable
are being bartered every day.</p>

<p>"A sixty-dollar nugget," Durant appraised
it, weighing it in his expert hand, "and valuable
merely as an earnest of what lies beneath&mdash;just
a chip of the old block; a clue
to the great Lode! Now, to take possession
formally!" He paced the ground, whittled
and marked the stakes, and was preparing<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
to post them, when a sudden thought arrested
him. "But&mdash;the land now lies within
the township limits!" he groaned. "Oh,
my girl, what, if, after all, my luck should
fail you!"</p>

<p>Evelyn smiled happily. "I think I can
come to your assistance in that matter. If
you will call to-morrow morning at the office
of E. Durant you can acquire the mineral
rights from the present owner of the
lot, who happens to be&mdash;myself. Then you
can record it as soon as the Commissioner's
books are open."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" Durant looked about with a
touch of the furtive apprehension that had
shadowed his recent life, and that never
wholly left him. "Suppose some one has
seen&mdash;how can I defend it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Evelyn, "no fear about that!
There are no claim-jumpers in this camp,
thanks to Scarlett of the Mounted."</p>

<p>"Aye, Scarlett. A fine fellow that. He
did me a great kindness last year," said her
father. "It began by his finding your picture,
which I had dropped, and giving it
back to me. If my foresight had been equal
to my hindsight, I should have confided my
discovery to him as soon as I made it, and
so saved you this year of bitter experience,
my girl."<span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>"Well, daddy," replied Evelyn, "if you
haven't suffered too much by it, not only do
I not regret it, but I'm glad. It has taught
me to value the gifts of the mother Lode infinitely
less, and infinitely more, than formerly.
I can hardly wait overnight to claim
my pot of gold from the rainbow's foot&mdash;but
I'm humbler about the possession of wealth
than I used to be. And I want the whole
camp to be 'in it.'"</p>

<p>"And so they shall, my girl," responded
Durant, heartily. Then, as two figures came
in sight, "There goes the Sergeant now, with
Mr. Maclane, passing by the gate. Suppose
we begin with them, Evie. Suppose we call
them in and tell them all about it." He already
was summoning them.</p>

<p>"Suppose, for the present, you take charge
of Mr. Maclane," amended Evelyn, as the
two drew near, "and leave the Sergeant to
me."</p>

<p>Scarlett and the minister were bent on
some errand in another quarter of the town,
but by tacit consent had taken the road past
Evelyn's cabin, actuated, in the case of the
older man, by a kind wish not to lose sight
of her for long, and in the case of the lover
by the force that guides all steps toward
the beloved. For, dismissed as he had been,
and dejected as he found himself accordingly,<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
yet in his heart of hearts there still
lurked a hope that she might relent toward
him. When, therefore, they saw Evelyn, radiant,
and beckoning to them from the veranda,
they joined her and her father with
alacrity. Nor did good Maclane need any
suggestion from Durant that the two young
people should be left to make their peace
unaided.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Scarlett," Evelyn began when
the older men had withdrawn to examine
Durant's discovery, "I want to beg your pardon
for the way I treated you this afternoon!
I felt bitter, cheated&mdash;oh, it wasn't
your fault one bit; it was my own, which
was why I was so angry with you. And you&mdash;all
along you have behaved so generously
to me&mdash;nobly!&mdash;Yes, let me finish," she
cried, retreating from the advance with
which he sought to interrupt her. "I shall
always think it&mdash;but I may not ever be in
the mood to tell you again quite how well I
think of you."</p>

<p>"But, Evelyn, dearest, what's the good of
compliments to a hungry man?" cried Scarlett.
"I'm asking ye for bread&mdash;and ye give
me the blarney-stone."</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed, and, sitting, patted the
place beside her, invitingly. "I'll tell you
the whole story. It's like a romance&mdash;I was<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
going to write you a letter about it if you
had not come."</p>

<p>"We'll write it together. We'll write it
all our lives." Her lover slipped an arm
about her. "But we'll start with the postscript."</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
